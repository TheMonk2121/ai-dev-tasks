# Product Requirements Document: B-1004 - Simplify Overengineered Quality Gates

## 1. Problem Statement

**What's broken?** The current quality gates are overengineered with complex caching systems, dead code (database sync check for removed metadata), and solving problems that don't exist. The conflict check script is 276 lines when it should be 5 lines.

**Why does it matter?** Overengineered gates are slow, fragile, hard to debug, and provide no real value. They create friction instead of improving code quality.

**What's the opportunity?** Simplify to fast, reliable gates that actually catch real issues and improve development velocity.

## 2. Solution Overview

**What are we building?** A streamlined quality gate system that focuses on actual problems: code quality, type safety, security, and basic validation.

**How does it work?** Replace complex scripts with simple, focused tools that do one thing well.

**What are the key features?** Fast execution (<5s), simple debugging, reliable operation, and actual value delivery.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

**How do we know it's done?**
- All quality gates complete in <5 seconds total
- No complex caching or parallel processing
- Database sync check removed entirely
- Conflict check reduced to 5 lines
- Type checking and security scanning added

**What does success look like?**
- Gates are boring and reliable
- Easy to debug when they fail
- Actually catch real issues
- Developers don't want to bypass them

**What are the quality gates?**
- Ruff linting passes
- Pyright type checking passes
- Basic security scanning passes
- No merge conflicts
- Documentation validation (simplified)

## 4. Technical Approach

**What technology?**
- Keep Ruff and Pyright (they're good)
- Add bandit for security scanning
- Replace complex scripts with simple bash commands
- Remove dead database sync code

**How does it integrate?**
- Simple pre-commit hooks
- No complex caching or state management
- Direct integration with existing tools

**What are the constraints?**
- Must be fast (<5s total)
- Must be reliable (no flaky failures)
- Must be simple (easy to debug)

## 5. Risks and Mitigation

**What could go wrong?**
- Removing too much and missing real issues
- Breaking existing workflows
- Performance regression

**How do we handle it?**
- Test thoroughly before removing anything
- Keep essential functionality
- Monitor for missed issues

**What are the unknowns?**
- Impact on development velocity
- Whether simplified gates catch all issues

## 6. Testing Strategy

**What needs testing?**
- Gate execution speed
- Error detection capability
- False positive rate
- Developer experience

**How do we test it?**
- Benchmark execution times
- Test with known issues
- Validate with real commits
- Survey developer satisfaction

**What's the coverage target?**
- 100% of gate functionality tested
- Performance benchmarks established

## 7. Implementation Plan

**What are the phases?**
1. Remove dead database sync check
2. Simplify conflict detection
3. Add missing security scanning
4. Optimize performance
5. Test and validate

**What are the dependencies?**
- No external dependencies
- Can be done incrementally

**What's the timeline?**
- 6 hours total effort
- Can be completed in one session
