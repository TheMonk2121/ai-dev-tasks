## 1. Problem Statement

### What's broken?
Current system lacks comprehensive decision intelligence and knowledge graph capabilities, missing ability to track decision evolution, understand decision impact, construct knowledge graphs from decisions, and perform AI-powered decision reasoning. The existing decision tracking system provides basic decision storage but cannot analyze decision patterns or construct knowledge graphs for reasoning.

### Why does it matter?
Without decision intelligence and knowledge graph capabilities, the system cannot answer critical questions like "What decisions led to this current state?" or "How have my decisions evolved over time?" This limits the system's ability to understand decision patterns, track decision impact, and provide AI-powered insights based on decision history.

### What's the opportunity?
Implement comprehensive decision intelligence and knowledge graph system that combines decision tracking, evolution analysis, impact assessment, knowledge graph construction, and AI-powered reasoning, integrated with existing decision intelligence and memory systems. This will transform the system from basic decision storage to intelligent decision analysis and knowledge graph reasoning.

## 2. Solution Overview

A comprehensive decision intelligence and knowledge graph system that combines decision tracking, evolution analysis, impact assessment, knowledge graph construction, and AI-powered reasoning, integrated with existing decision intelligence and memory systems.

### How does it work?

Memory system integration provides context-aware decision analysis.
