### Development Patterns
- **Memory Systems**: `100_memory/` - Context storage and retrieval
- **Scripts**: `scripts/` - Core functionality and automation
- **Documentation**: `400_guides/` - Comprehensive usage guides
- **Metrics**: `metrics/` - System outputs and evaluation results

### Local Developmen
```bash
# Verify vector store access
python3 scripts/unified_memory_orchestrator.py --systems cursor --role planner "test query"

# Check system dependencies
python3 -c "import ast; print('✅ AST parsing available for dependency analysis')"

# Test memory system integration
python3 scripts/memory_rehydrate.py --tes

# Verify documentation structure
ls -la 400_guides/ | grep "400_"
```

### Common Tasks
- **Add new component**: Update dependency mapping when adding scripts or systems
- **Update relationships**: Modify dependency graph when changing integrations
- **Analyze impact**: Query system map for change impact assessmen
- **Optimize workflows**: Use dependency analysis for workflow optimization

## 1. Problem Statement

### What's broken?
The current system lacks a comprehensive understanding of how components relate to each other. When making changes, it's difficult to predict what might break or what other systems will be affected. The vector store contains rich information about components but isn't being used to create an intelligent system map.

### Why does it matter?
Without understanding dependencies and relationships, development decisions are made in isolation, leading to:
- **Unexpected breakages** when modifying seemingly unrelated components
- **Missed optimization opportunities** due to lack of system-wide visibility
- **Inefficient development workflows** without understanding critical paths
- **Poor resource allocation** without knowing which components are most critical

### What's the opportunity?
By leveraging the existing vector store to create an intelligent system map, we can:
- **Make informed development decisions** with full dependency visibility
- **Optimize system performance** by understanding critical paths and bottlenecks
- **Improve the coder role** with context-aware suggestions and impact analysis
- **Streamline workflows** by identifying the most efficient development paths

## 2. Solution Overview

### What are we building?
A vector-based system mapping tool that creates an intelligent, searchable map of system dependencies, core paths, and component relationships using the existing vector store infrastructure.

### How does it work?
The solution analyzes the codebase to extract dependencies, encodes components as vectors in the existing vector store, and provides query interfaces to understand relationships, predict impacts, and optimize development workflows.

### What are the key features?
- **Dependency Mapping**: Automatic extraction and visualization of component dependencies
- **Vector-Based Queries**: Natural language queries about system relationships
- **Impact Analysis**: Predict what might break when making changes
- **Critical Path Identification**: Find bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- **Memory System Integration**: Seamless integration with existing LTST, Cursor, Go CLI systems
- **Coder Role Enhancement**: Provide context-aware suggestions for development decisions
