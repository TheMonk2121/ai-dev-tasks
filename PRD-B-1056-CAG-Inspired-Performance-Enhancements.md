## 1. Problem Statement

### What's broken?
The current memory system lacks persistent caching of AI generation outputs, missing cache-augmented generation with similarity scoring. Additionally, it lacks cutting-edge AI optimization techniques like Pareto frontier optimization, natural language feedback, and reflection-based self-optimization. This leads to repeated AI model calls, slower response times, increased API costs, and suboptimal cache performance that could be significantly improved with modern AI optimization approaches.

### Why does it matter?
Poor caching performance affects user satisfaction through slower response times, increases operational costs through repeated AI model API calls, and limits system scalability. Without intelligent caching and AI-driven optimization, the memory system cannot efficiently serve frequently accessed contexts, leading to performance degradation under increased load and missed opportunities for optimization. The system is missing the revolutionary performance gains possible with Pareto frontier optimization and reflection-based self-improvement.

### What's the opportunity?
By implementing a PostgreSQL-based generation cache with similarity scoring AND cutting-edge AI optimization techniques, we can achieve 75-90% performance improvement (vs. 50-75% without AI optimization), reduce AI model API costs, and create a self-optimizing memory system. This creates a foundation for intelligent cache-augmented generation with continuous self-improvement, enabling faster responses for similar queries and better resource utilization across the entire memory system.

## 2. Solution Overview

### What are we building?
A revolutionary PostgreSQL-based generation cache system with intelligent similarity scoring, cache hit tracking, seamless integration with the existing LTST memory system, AND cutting-edge AI optimization techniques including Pareto frontier optimization, natural language feedback, and reflection-based self-optimization. The system will enable cache-augmented generation support with persistent storage, automatic cache invalidation, performance monitoring, and continuous AI-driven self-improvement.

### How does it work?
The enhanced cache system extends the existing episodic_logs table with cache-specific columns, implements vector similarity search for intelligent cache retrieval, integrates with the LTST memory system for context-aware caching, AND employs advanced AI optimization techniques. The system uses Pareto frontier optimization to balance multiple performance objectives, natural language feedback for rich performance insights, and reflection-based optimization for continuous self-improvement.

### What are the key features?
- **PostgreSQL Cache Backend**: Persistent caching with database storage and vector similarity
