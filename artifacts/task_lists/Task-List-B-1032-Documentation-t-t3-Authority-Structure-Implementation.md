- [ ] **Code Review** - All code has been reviewed
- [ ] **Tests Passing** - All tests pass with 80% coverage
- [ ] **Performance Validated** - Generation completes within 15 minutes
- [ ] **Security Reviewed** - AI system properly secured
- [ ] **Documentation Updated** - AI generation procedures documented

**Solo Workflow Integration**:
- **Auto-Advance**: no - Will task auto-advance to next?
- **Context Preservation**: yes - Does task preserve context for next session?
- **One-Command**: yes - Can task be executed with single command?
- **Smart Pause**: yes - Should task pause for user input?

## Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage Target**: 90% for Must/Should tasks, 85% for Could tasks, 80% for Won't tasks
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Validation <10s, Analysis <5min, Consolidation <3min
- **Security Requirements**: No sensitive data exposure, secure file system access
- **Reliability Targets**: 95% uptime for validation systems, 90% accuracy for AI systems
- **MoSCoW Alignment**: Must tasks completed first, Should tasks prioritized over Could
- **Solo Optimization**: Auto-advance enabled for 80% of tasks, context preservation for all

## Risk Mitigation
- **Technical Risks**: Incremental implementation with rollback capability, comprehensive testing
- **Timeline Risks**: Phased approach with clear milestones, parallel task execution where possible
- **Resource Risks**: Solo developer optimizations, automated workflows, clear task dependencies
- **Priority Risks**: MoSCoW prioritization with clear acceptance criteria, regular priority reviews
