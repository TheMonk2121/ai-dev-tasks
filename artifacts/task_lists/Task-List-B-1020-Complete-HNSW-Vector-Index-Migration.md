  - **Mitigation**: Parameter validation, rollback procedures

### Medium-Risk Tasks
- **Task 3.1**: Performance regression possible
  - **Mitigation**: Before/after benchmarking, gradual testing
- **Task 3.2**: Application compatibility issues
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, error monitoring

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
- [ ] All vector indexes use HNSW with optimal parameters
- [ ] No IVFFlat indexes remain in the database
- [ ] Vector search performance improved or maintained
- [ ] No data loss during migration

### Secondary Success Metrics
- [ ] Storage space reduced from index optimization
- [ ] Migration process documented for future use
- [ ] Application compatibility maintained
- [ ] Performance monitoring improved

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during migration:
1. **Immediate rollback**: Restore from backup if data corruption occurs
2. **Performance rollback**: Recreate IVFFlat indexes if performance degrades
3. **Application rollback**: Revert to previous index configuration if compatibility issues arise

## Post-Migration Validation

- [ ] All vector searches return results
- [ ] Application functionality verified
- [ ] Performance metrics collected

### Short-term Validation (Week 1)
- [ ] Monitor for performance issues
- [ ] Validate in production-like scenarios
- [ ] Collect user feedback if applicable

### Long-term Validation (Month 1)
