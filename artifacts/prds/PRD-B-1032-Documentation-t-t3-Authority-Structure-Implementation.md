## 0. Project Context & Implementation Guide

### Current Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.12, PostgreSQL 14, pgvector 0.8.0
- **Documentation**: Markdown, HTML comments for metadata, pre-commit hooks
- **Automation**: Python scripts, bash scripts, pre-commit hooks, post-commit hooks
- **Development**: Ruff, Pyright, pytest, pre-commit framework
- **Infrastructure**: Local-first approach, no external dependencies

```

### Development Patterns
- **Documentation**: `400_guides/` - All guides with 400_ prefix
- **Memory**: `100_memory/` - AI context and memory files
- **Core**: `000_core/` - Essential workflow files
- **Scripts**: `scripts/` - Automation and utility scripts
- **Validation**: Pre-commit hooks for quality enforcement

### Local Development
```bash
# Setup
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run validation
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Generate documentation analysis
python3 scripts/documentation_analyzer.py
```

### Common Tasks
- **Add new guide**: Create in `400_guides/` with 400_ prefix
- **Update validation**: Modify pre-commit hooks in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- **Analyze usage**: Run `scripts/documentation_usage_analyzer.py`
- **Consolidate guides**: Use `scripts/documentation_consolidator.py`

## 1. Problem Statement

### What's broken?
The current `400_guides` documentation system is a bloated nightmare with 52 files that lack clear authority structure, have inconsistent naming conventions, and no systematic lifecycle management. Users cannot determine which guide is authoritative, content is duplicated across files, and there's no governance to prevent bloat or maintain quality.

### Why does it matter?
This documentation confusion directly impacts development efficiency, AI agent comprehension, and system reliability. When developers and AI agents cannot quickly find authoritative information, they waste time searching, make incorrect assumptions, or create duplicate content, leading to technical debt and inconsistent implementations.

### What's the opportunity?
By implementing a t-t3 authority structure with automated lifecycle management, we can create a governance system that aligns with our core values of automation over documentation, while maintaining the valuable resource that guides provide for comprehension and reference.

## 2. Solution Overview

### What are we building?
A tiered documentation governance system (t-t3) that establishes clear authority hierarchy, implements automated lifecycle management, and provides systematic quality control through usage analysis and smart consolidation.

### How does it work?
The system uses three tiers: Tier 1 (authoritative, 500-1500 lines), Tier 2 (supporting, 1000-2000 lines), and Tier 3 (reference, flexible sizing). Automated analysis tracks usage patterns, identifies consolidation opportunities, and enforces quality gates through pre-commit hooks and validation systems.

### What are the key features?
- **Authority Structure**: Clear hierarchy with Tier 1 as single source of truth
- **Usage Analysis**: Automated tracking of guide usage and effectiveness
- **Smart Consolidation**: AI-powered suggestions for merging related content
- **Quality Gates**: Automated validation of size, freshness, and cross-references
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automated archiving, consolidation, and maintenance

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

### How do we know it's done?
- [ ] All 52 current guides categorized into t-t3 structure with clear authority
- [ ] Automated usage analysis system operational with 95% coverage
- [ ] Smart consolidation system identifies and merges 30% of duplicate content
- [ ] Quality gates prevent new bloat with 100% validation coverage
- [ ] Zero breaking changes to existing workflow and documentation access

### What does success look like?
- **Authority Clarity**: 100% of users can identify authoritative guide within 30 seconds
- **Content Reduction**: 40% reduction in total documentation lines through consolidation
- **Quality Improvement**: 90% of guides pass all quality gates
- **Usage Optimization**: 80% of guide access goes to Tier 1 authoritative sources

### What are the quality gates?
- [ ] All guides must have clear tier designation and authority level
- [ ] Size limits enforced: Tier 1 (500-1500), Tier 2 (1000-2000), Tier 3 (flexible)
- [ ] Cross-references must be valid and up-to-date
- [ ] Usage analysis must show positive engagement metrics
- [ ] No duplicate content across guides (consolidation required)

## 4. Technical Approach

### What technology?
- **Analysis Engine**: Python with pandas for usage analysis
- **Validation System**: Pre-commit hooks with custom validation scripts
- **Consolidation Engine**: AI-powered content analysis and merging
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for usage tracking and metrics
- **Automation**: Python scripts integrated with existing workflow

### How does it integrate?
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Extends existing validation framework
- **Memory System**: Integrates with LTST memory for context preservation
- **Workflow Chain**: Maintains compatibility with 001-003 workflow
- **Documentation Retrieval**: Enhances existing RAG system with authority weighting

### What are the constraints?
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Must maintain existing workflow compatibility
- **Local-First**: No external dependencies or cloud services
- **Performance**: Analysis must complete within 30 seconds
- **Governance**: Must align with automation-over-documentation philosophy

## 5. Risks and Mitigation

### What could go wrong?
- **Risk 1**: Consolidation loses important context or creates confusion
- **Risk 2**: Quality gates become too restrictive and block legitimate changes
- **Risk 3**: Usage analysis provides incorrect recommendations
- **Risk 4**: Migration process breaks existing cross-references

### How do we handle it?
- **Mitigation 1**: Incremental consolidation with human review and rollback capability
- **Mitigation 2**: Configurable quality gates with bypass options for emergencies
- **Mitigation 3**: Multiple analysis methods with confidence scoring and human validation
- **Mitigation 4**: Comprehensive cross-reference validation and automated repair tools

### What are the unknowns?
- **Usage Patterns**: How current guides are actually used by AI agents and developers
- **Consolidation Effectiveness**: Whether AI-powered merging maintains quality
- **Authority Recognition**: How quickly users adapt to new authority structure
- **Performance Impact**: Effect of validation system on development workflow

## 6. Testing Strategy

### What needs testing?
- **Validation System**: Quality gates and enforcement mechanisms
- **Consolidation Engine**: Content merging accuracy and quality preservation
- **Usage Analysis**: Data collection accuracy and recommendation quality
- **Migration Process**: Cross-reference preservation and workflow compatibility

### How do we test it?
- **Unit Tests**: Individual validation rules and analysis functions
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow with sample documentation
- **User Acceptance Tests**: Real usage scenarios with current guide set
