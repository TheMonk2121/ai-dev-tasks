# Product Requirements Document: Cursor Native AI Role Coordination System

## 1. Executive Summary

**Project**: Cursor Native AI Role Coordination System
**Success Metrics**: Cursor Native AI consults appropriate roles before making structural decisions
**Timeline**: 6 hours implementation
**Stakeholders**: Solo developer, AI development ecosystem

## 2. Problem Statement

**Current State**: Cursor Native AI makes unilateral decisions about file organization, placement, and structural changes without consulting the appropriate specialized roles in the system.

**Pain Points**:
- Poor file placement decisions (e.g., putting automation guides in 100_memory/)
- Bypassing established role-based workflows
- Inconsistent adherence to project conventions
- No systematic role consultation for decisions

**Opportunity**: Implement a role coordination system that ensures Cursor Native AI consults appropriate roles before making structural decisions.

**Impact**: Improves decision quality, maintains project consistency, and leverages the sophisticated multi-role system effectively.

## 3. Solution Overview

**High-Level Solution**: Implement role coordination rules and protocols that Cursor Native AI must follow before making file organization or structural decisions.

**Key Features**:
- Mandatory role consultation for structural decisions
- Clear decision trees for role selection
- Integration with memory rehydration system
- Fallback protocols for edge cases
- Decision transparency and logging

**Technical Approach**: Cursor rules + memory rehydration integration + decision protocols

**Integration Points**:
- .cursorrules file for immediate rules
- Memory rehydration system for role context
- Existing role system for consultation
- Decision logging for transparency
