### Development Patterns
- **MCP Servers**: `src/utils/mcp_integration/` - Specialized MCP server implementations
- **Agent Modules**: `src/dspy_modules/` - DSPy agent roles and capabilities
- **Memory System**: `src/utils/` - Memory rehydration and context management
- **Monitoring**: `src/monitoring/` - Performance tracking and metrics

### Local Development
```bash
# Setup MCP Memory Server
./scripts/start_mcp_server.sh

# Test MCP server health
curl -s http://localhost:3000/health

# Check available tools
curl -s http://localhost:3000/mcp | jq '.tools | length'

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Start development environment
poetry install
poetry run pre-commit install
```

### Common Tasks
- **Add new MCP server**: Create implementation in `src/utils/mcp_integration/`
- **Add new agent tool**: Extend `scripts/mcp_memory_server.py` with new tool definition
- **Add new role context**: Update `src/dspy_modules/context_models.py`
- **Monitor performance**: Check `http://localhost:3000/metrics` for server metrics

## 1. Problem Statement

### What's broken?
Currently, the MCP Memory Server only provides 5 memory rehydration tools, while the system has 6 additional specialized MCP servers (FileSystem, Web, PDF, GitHub, Database, Office) that are implemented but not accessible to agents. This creates a significant capability gap where agents cannot access document processing, GitHub integration, database access, or web crawling tools.

### Why does it matter?
Agents are limited to memory rehydration tasks and cannot perform comprehensive research, code analysis, or document processing. This severely restricts their ability to assist with complex development tasks that require access to external data sources, repositories, or document processing capabilities.

### What's the opportunity?
By implementing MCP server orchestration, we can provide agents with access to a comprehensive tool ecosystem including:
- **GitHub Integration**: Repository analysis, issue tracking, PR management
- **Database Access**: Schema analysis, data insights, query optimization
- **Document Processing**: PDF analysis, web crawling, file system operations
- **Enhanced Research**: Multi-source data gathering and analysis

## 2. Solution Overview

### What are we building?
A comprehensive MCP server orchestration system that provides a unified gateway for agents to access multiple specialized MCP servers through intelligent routing, security controls, and performance optimization.

### How does it work?
The orchestration system will:
1. **Discover** available MCP servers and their capabilities
2. **Route** agent requests to appropriate specialized servers
3. **Manage** security and access controls for each tool type
4. **Optimize** performance through caching and connection pooling
5. **Monitor** system health and provide fallback mechanisms

### What are the key features?
- **Unified Tool Gateway**: Single endpoint for all MCP tools across multiple servers
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic tool selection based on agent role and task
- **Security Controls**: Role-based access control and safe tool execution
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching, connection pooling, and request batching
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of all MCP servers
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback mechanisms when servers are unavailable
