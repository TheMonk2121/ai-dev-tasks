- **Add memory component**: Extend LTST Memory System with new persistence or retrieval methods

## 1. Problem Statement

### What's broken?
The current AI development ecosystem has implicit mathematical structure that lacks formal guarantees. Artifact transformations (PRD → Tasks → Code → Tests → Deploy) are string-based and error-prone, DSPy agent state transitions are not formally validated, and governance rules rely on manual enforcement rather than mathematical invariants.

### Why does it matter?
Without formal mathematical foundations, the system lacks:
- **Provenance guarantees**: Cannot mathematically prove artifact lineage
- **Agent safety**: No formal validation of DSPy agent state transitions
- **Composability**: Cannot guarantee that artifact transformations preserve structure
- **Auditability**: No mathematical basis for system correctness verification
- **Optimization**: Cannot leverage mathematical properties for automatic improvements

### What's the opportunity?
Implementing category theory (topos) and coalgebras with learning scaffolding provides:
- **Full Mathematical Framework**: Complete ChatGPT Pro implementation with all advanced features
- **Learning Scaffolding**: Progressive complexity, interactive examples, and just-in-time documentation
- **Formal governance**: Explicit morphism laws with mathematical validation
- **Guaranteed traceability**: Type-safe artifact transformations with coalgebraic state transitions
- **Agent safety**: Formal behavior guarantees for DSPy agents with state machine validation
- **Automatic optimization**: Mathematical structure enables compiler-like optimizations
- **Scalable reliability**: Mathematical guarantees hold regardless of system size
- **User Growth**: Structured learning path through challenging implementation
