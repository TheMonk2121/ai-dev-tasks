# Process Task List: B-1055 - Deep Research Agent Integration with Local AI Model Testing

## üîé TL;DR

| what this file is | read when | do next |
|---|---|---|
| Enhanced task execution workflow with solo developer optimizations, auto-advance, and context preservation for B-1055 | Ready to execute B-1055 implementation | Run solo workflow CLI to start automated execution with smart pausing |

## üéØ **Current Status**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **READY FOR EXECUTION** - Enhanced task execution workflow with solo optimizations
- **Priority**: üî• Critical - Essential for project execution
- **Points**: 8 - High complexity, high importance
- **Dependencies**: B-1034 (Mathematical Framework Foundation)
- **Next Steps**: Solo workflow CLI with auto-advance and context preservation

## When to use

- Use when ready to execute B-1055 Deep Research Agent Integration
- Use for automated execution with smart pausing and context preservation
- Use for solo developer workflows with one-command operations
- **B-1055**: Deep Research Agent Integration - Ready for execution

### Execution Skip Rule

- Skip automated execution when: tasks require extensive user input or external dependencies
- Otherwise, use solo workflow CLI for automated execution with smart pausing

### Backlog Integration

- **Input**: Task list from B-1055 with 28 tasks across 7 phases
- **Output**: Execution configuration and state management with PRD context integration
- **Cross-reference**: `000_core/000_backlog.md` for item details and metadata
- **PRD Integration**: Use Section 0 context for execution guidance and technical patterns

## Enhanced Workflow

### üöÄ **Solo Developer Quick Start (Recommended)**

For streamlined, automated execution with solo developer optimizations:

```bash
# Start everything (B-1055 implementation with local AI model testing)
python3 scripts/solo_workflow.py start "B-1055 Deep Research Agent Integration with Local AI Model Testing"

# Continue where you left off
python3 scripts/solo_workflow.py continue

# Ship when done
python3 scripts/solo_workflow.py ship
```

### Context Preservation
- **LTST Memory**: Maintains context across sessions with PRD Section 0 integration
- **Auto-Advance**: Tasks auto-advance unless you pause
- **Smart Pausing**: Pause only for critical decisions or external dependencies
- **PRD Context**: Use Section 0 (Project Context & Implementation Guide) for execution guidance

### ü§ñ **Automated Execution Engine**

For consistent, high-quality task execution:

```bash
# Execute tasks from B-1055 with auto-advance
python3 scripts/solo_workflow.py execute --backlog-id B-1055 --auto-advance

# Execute with smart pausing
python3 scripts/solo_workflow.py execute --backlog-id B-1055 --smart-pause

# Execute with context preservation
python3 scripts/solo_workflow.py execute --backlog-id B-1055 --context-preserve
```

### üìù **Manual Process (Fallback)**

- Parse task list from B-1055 for 28 tasks across 7 phases
- Use PRD Section 0 (Project Context & Implementation Guide) for execution context
- Execute tasks manually with state tracking and PRD context integration
- Update progress in `.ai_state.json` with PRD metadata

3. **Execute recovery**: Run recovery task with retry logic for model failures
4. **Validate fix**: Confirm local model integration issue is resolved
5. **Continue execution**: Resume normal task flow for research agent development
