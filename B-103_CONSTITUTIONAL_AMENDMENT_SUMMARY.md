# B-103 Constitutional Amendment Summary

## 🎯 **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Constitutional Rule Codified

**Date**: 2025-08-16
**Constitution Version**: 1.0 → 1.1
**Amendment**: Article V - Governance & Repository Management

## 📋 **Changes Implemented**

### **1. B-103 Repo Layout Normalization**
- **Moved to P0 Lane** (Governance/Non-Negotiables)
- **Priority**: P0 blocker for all feature work
- **Scope**: Consolidate test directory, unify pyproject.toml, enforce one import resolution strategy

### **2. Constitutional Amendment (Article V)**
**New Governance Rule**: All issues related to:
- File organization (e.g. duplicate configs, split test dirs)
- Import resolution conflicts
- Environment setup for deterministic execution
- Configuration file consolidation
- Directory structure normalization

**Are automatically classified as P0 Governance Items**. They are non-negotiable prerequisites for feature work and block all dependent backlog items until resolved.

### **3. Priority Structure Enforcement**
- **P0 Lane**: Governance/trust issues (repo structure, import resolution, validator configuration)
- **🔥 Critical**: Feature work (implementation, new capabilities, performance optimization)
- **Dependencies**: All feature work must wait for P0 governance items to be resolved

### **4. Governance Decision Authority**
- P0 items require immediate attention and cannot be deferred
- Feature work blocked by P0 items must be paused until governance is resolved
- All AI systems must respect P0 governance priority over feature development

## 🎯 **Impact**

### **Immediate Benefits:**
- ✅ **Clear governance/feature distinction** - no more ambiguity
- ✅ **Automatic P0 classification** for repo layout issues
- ✅ **Blocking dependency enforcement** for feature work
- ✅ **Constitutional authority** for governance decisions

### **Long-term Benefits:**
- ✅ **Prevents future re-litigation** of "is this governance or feature?"
- ✅ **Embedded decision framework** in constitution
- ✅ **Consistent priority enforcement** across all AI systems
- ✅ **Foundation for stable development** environment

## 📊 **Current P0 Lane Status**

- B‑052‑d — CI GitHub Action (Dry-Run Gate) (score 8.0)
- B‑062 — Context Priority Guide Auto-Generation (score 8.0)
- **B‑103 — Repo Layout Normalization (score 4.3)** ← **NEW P0 ITEM**

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

**B-103 Implementation Ready:**
- Constitutional rule is codified
- Priority structure is enforced
- Governance authority is established
- Ready to proceed with repo layout normalization

**Status**: ✅ **Constitutional amendment completed** - governance rule is now embedded in the constitution and will prevent future ambiguity about priority classification.
