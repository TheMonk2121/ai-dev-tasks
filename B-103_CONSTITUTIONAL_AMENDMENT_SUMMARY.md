**Date**: 2025-08-16
**Constitution Version**: 1.0 ‚Üí 1.1
**Amendment**: Article V - Governance & Repository Management

## üìã **Changes Implemented**

### **1. B-103 Repo Layout Normalization**
- **Moved to P0 Lane** (Governance/Non-Negotiables)
- **Priority**: P0 blocker for all feature work
- **Scope**: Consolidate test directory, unify pyproject.toml, enforce one import resolution strategy

### **2. Constitutional Amendment (Article V)**
**New Governance Rule**: All issues related to:
- File organization (e.g. duplicate configs, split test dirs)
- Import resolution conflicts
- Environment setup for deterministic execution
- Configuration file consolidation
- Directory structure normalization

**Are automatically classified as P0 Governance Items**. They are non-negotiable prerequisites for feature work and block all dependent backlog items until resolved.

### **3. Priority Structure Enforcement**
- **P0 Lane**: Governance/trust issues (repo structure, import resolution, validator configuration)
- **üî• Critical**: Feature work (implementation, new capabilities, performance optimization)
- **Dependencies**: All feature work must wait for P0 governance items to be resolved

### **4. Governance Decision Authority**
- P0 items require immediate attention and cannot be deferred
- Feature work blocked by P0 items must be paused until governance is resolved
- All AI systems must respect P0 governance priority over feature development

## üéØ **Impact**

### **Immediate Benefits:**
- OK **Clear governance/feature distinction** - no more ambiguity
- OK **Automatic P0 classification** for repo layout issues
- OK **Blocking dependency enforcement** for feature work
- OK **Constitutional authority** for governance decisions

### **Long-term Benefits:**
- OK **Prevents future re-litigation** of "is this governance or feature?"
- OK **Embedded decision framework** in constitution
- OK **Consistent priority enforcement** across all AI systems
- OK **Foundation for stable development** environment

## üìä **Current P0 Lane Status**

- B-052-d - CI GitHub Action (Dry-Run Gate) (score 8.0)
- B-062 - Context Priority Guide Auto-Generation (score 8.0)
- **B-103 - Repo Layout Normalization (score 4.3)** ‚Üê **NEW P0 ITEM**

## üöÄ **Next Steps**
