### Development Patterns
- **Research Documentation**: `500_research/` - Literature analysis and research findings
- **Benchmark Scripts**: `scripts/` - Performance testing and evaluation
- **Memory Context**: `100_memory/` - AI context and memory files with YAML front-matter
- **Documentation**: `400_guides/` - Comprehensive guides with optimal patterns
- **Integration**: Memory system integration with DSPy and RAG components

### Local Development
```bash
# Setup research environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run benchmark tests
python3 scripts/memory_benchmark.py

# Check memory system status
python3 scripts/unified_memory_orchestrator.py --systems ltst cursor --role researcher "memory architecture status"

# Validate documentation structure
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Common Tasks
- **Add research findings**: Document in `500_research/` with literature analysis
- **Update benchmark scripts**: Modify `scripts/memory_benchmark.py` for new test cases
- **Implement YAML front-matter**: Add to memory context files for improved retrieval
- **Update documentation**: Maintain 00-12 guide system with optimal patterns
- **Test model adaptations**: Validate performance across different AI model capabilities

## 1. Problem Statement

### What's broken?
The current memory context system uses a flat hierarchy with HTML comments for metadata, which doesn't optimize for different AI model capabilities (7B vs 70B vs 128k context models). The system lacks model-specific adaptations, efficient token usage patterns, and resilience to file structure changes, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance and context utilization.

### Why does it matter?
The memory system is the foundation of the AI development ecosystem, providing context for all AI agents and decision-making processes. Poor memory architecture reduces retrieval accuracy, increases token costs, and limits the system's ability to scale across different model capabilities. This impacts the entire development workflow and AI agent performance.

### What's the opportunity?
Implementing model-aware memory architecture with YAML front-matter, hierarchical organization, and intelligent overflow handling can provide ≥10% improvement in retrieval F1 on 7B models, reduce token usage by ≥20%, and create a resilient system that adapts to different AI model capabilities while maintaining performance across file structure changes.

## 2. Solution Overview

### What are we building?
A research-driven memory context system architecture that optimizes memory hierarchy for different AI model capabilities through literature analysis, benchmark testing, and model-specific adaptations with YAML front-matter and intelligent overflow handling.

### How does it work?
The solution combines cognitive science research with AI retrieval optimization to create a three-tier hierarchy (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) with YAML front-matter, dual-encoding strategies, sliding-window summarizers for overflow handling, and model-specific chunk sizing that adapts to different context windows (8k, 32k, 128k).

### What are the key features?
- **Model-Aware Architecture**: Optimized for 7B, 70B, and 128k context models
- **YAML Front-Matter**: Explicit metadata for improved retrieval accuracy
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Three-tier priority system (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- **Overflow Handling**: Sliding-window summarizers for context > 8k tokens
- **Resilience Patterns**: Version aliasing and migration strategies
- **Benchmark Framework**: Comprehensive testing across model capabilities
- **Literature Integration**: Research-backed optimization strategies
