## ‚ú® The Core Idea

Building complex features with AI can sometimes feel like a black box. This workflow aims to bring structure, clarity,
and control to the process by:

1.**Defining Scope:**Clearly outlining what needs to be built with a Product Requirement Document (PRD).
2.**Detailed Planning:**Breaking down the PRD into a granular, actionable task list optimized for AI execution.
3.**AI-Optimized Implementation:**Guiding AI agents to tackle tasks efficiently with strategic human checkpoints.

This structured approach helps ensure the AI stays on track, makes it easier to debug issues, and gives you confidence
in the generated code.

## Workflow: From Idea to Implemented Feature üí°‚û°Ô∏èüíª

Here's the step-by-step process using the `.md` files in this repository:

### 0Ô∏è‚É£ Select from Backlog (the execution engine)

For systematic development, start by selecting a high-impact feature from the backlog:

1. Ensure you have the `000_backlog.md` file from this repository accessible.
2. Review the prioritized table and select a feature based on:
  - **Points**: Lower numbers (1-3) for quick wins, higher (5-13) for complex features
  - **Priority**: üî• Critical, ‚≠ê High, üìà Medium, üîß Low
  - **Status**: Choose "todo" items for new work
  - **Dependencies**: Check if prerequisites are completed
  - **Scores**: Higher scores (5.0+) indicate higher priority items

3. Use the backlog item ID (e.g., B-001) as input for PRD creation in the next step.
4. The AI can automatically parse the table format and generate PRDs using the AI-BACKLOG-META command.

- üí° **Pro Tip**: Check `200_naming-conventions.md` to understand the file organization and naming patterns used in this
project.*

- üìã **For detailed backlog usage instructions and scoring system, see `100_backlog-guide.md`*### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Product Requirement Document (PRD)

First, lay out the blueprint for your feature. A PRD clarifies what you're building, for whom, and why.

You can create a lightweight PRD directly within your AI tool of choice:

1. Ensure you have the `001_create-prd.md` file from this repository accessible.
2. In your AI tool, initiate PRD creation:

    ```text
    Use @001_create-prd.md
    Here's the feature I want to build: [Describe your feature in detail]
    Backlog ID: [e.g., B-001 for Real-time Mission Dashboard]
    Reference these files to help you: [Optional: @file1.py @file2.ts @000_backlog.md]
    ```text*(Pro Tip: For Cursor users, MAX mode is recommended for complex PRDs if your budget allows for more comprehensive
generation.)*![Example of initiating PRD creation](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Go6DDlyX0AAS7JE?format=jpg&name=large)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Your Task List from the PRD

With your PRD drafted (e.g., `MyFeature-PRD.md`), the next step is to generate a detailed, step-by-step implementation
plan optimized for AI execution.

1. Ensure you have `002_generate-tasks.md` accessible.
2. In your AI tool, use the PRD to create tasks:

    ```text
    Now take @MyFeature-PRD.md and create tasks using @002_generate-tasks.md
    ```text*(Note: Replace `@MyFeature-PRD.md` with the actual filename of the PRD you generated in step 1.)*![Example of generating tasks from PRD](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Go6FITbWkAA-RCT?format=jpg&name=medium)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Examine Your Task List

You'll now have a well-structured task list optimized for AI execution, with clear dependencies, priorities, and
strategic human checkpoints. This provides a clear roadmap for implementation.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Execute Tasks with AI-Optimized Processing

To ensure methodical progress and allow for verification, we'll use `003_process-task-list.md` (the execution engine).
This system is designed for AI agents using the v0.3.1 Ultra-Minimal Router architecture (Cursor Native AI + Specialized
Agents) with strategic human oversight.

1. Create or ensure you have the `003_process-task-list.md` file accessible.
2. In your AI tool, tell the AI to start with the first task:

    ```text
    Please start on task T-1 and use @003_process-task-list.md (the execution engine)
    ```*(Important: You only need to reference `@003_process-task-list.md` for the *first* task. The instructions within it
guide the AI for subsequent tasks.)*The AI will attempt the task and then pause only when necessary for human review.

![Example of starting on a task with
process-task-list.md](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Go6I41KWcAAAlHc?format=jpg&name=medium)

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Optimized Execution with Strategic Checkpoints ‚úÖ

The AI system will automatically:

- **Execute tasks efficiently**with state caching and auto-advance

- **Handle errors gracefully**with automatic HotFix task generation

- **Pause strategically**only for high-risk operations (deployments, database changes)

- **Track progress**with clear status indicators (`[ ]`, `[x]`, `[!]`)

- **Prioritize by scores**when available for optimal task selection

You'll see a satisfying list of completed items grow, providing a clear visual of your feature coming to life!

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Maintenance & Consistency (the execution engine)

After making model changes or large documentation updates, run `999_repo-maintenance.md` to ensure consistency across
all files.

![Example of a progressing task list with completed
items](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Go6KrXZWkAA_UuX?format=jpg&name=medium)

While it's not always perfect, this method has proven to be a very reliable way to build out larger features with AI
assistance.
