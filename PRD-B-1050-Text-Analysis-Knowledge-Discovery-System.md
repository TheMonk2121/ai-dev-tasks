## 1. Problem Statement

### What's broken?
Current system lacks text analysis and knowledge discovery capabilities, missing ability to analyze documents for concept relationships, detect structural gaps, generate bridge insights, and perform market study analysis for research enhancement. The existing GraphDataProvider only handles chunk relationships but cannot analyze text content for concept mapping.

### Why does it matter?
Without text analysis capabilities, the system cannot discover hidden relationships between concepts, identify knowledge gaps, or generate AI-powered insights to connect disconnected areas. This limits the system's ability to enhance cognitive scaffolding and research capabilities, reducing the effectiveness of the AI development ecosystem.

### What's the opportunity?
Implement comprehensive text analysis and knowledge discovery system that enhances cognitive scaffolding through co-occurrence analysis, gap detection, bridge generation, and market study features, integrated with existing visualization and AI infrastructure. This will transform the system from simple chunk visualization to sophisticated knowledge discovery.

## 2. Solution Overview

### What are we building?
A comprehensive text analysis and knowledge discovery system that combines co-occurrence analysis, entity-aware concept mapping, gap detection, bridge generation, and market study capabilities, integrated with existing GraphDataProvider infrastructure.

### How does it work?
Text documents are processed through co-occurrence analysis to identify concept relationships, enhanced with entity extraction for better concept mapping, analyzed for structural gaps between concept clusters, and used to generate AI-powered bridge insights through DSPy modules. Market study features provide supply/demand analysis for research topics.

### What are the key features?
- **Co-occurrence Analysis**: Sliding window analysis to identify concept relationships
- **Entity-Aware Mapping**: Integration with existing entity extraction for enhanced concept mapping
- **Gap Detection**: Identify structural gaps between concept clusters
