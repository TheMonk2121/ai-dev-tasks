| Internal lessons learned from project implementation | Implementing similar features or making decisions | Apply relevant lessons to new backlog items and PRDs |

## Reference Discipline {#reference-discipline}

**Lesson**: Cross-references must be actively maintained and validated.

**Context**: Early backlog items lacked systematic cross-references, leading to orphaned requirements and lost context.

**Implementation**: 
- Every active backlog item must have `lessons_applied` and/or `reference_cards`
- Validator enforces cross-reference requirements (B-102)
- Stale link detection prevents broken references

**Benefits**:
- Prevents knowledge loss
- Ensures decisions are grounded in evidence
- Enables systematic learning

## Few-Shot Patterns {#few-shot-patterns}

**Context**: AI responses varied significantly across sessions until we implemented few-shot cognitive scaffolding.

**Implementation**:
- Extract patterns from high-quality examples
- Inject into memory rehydration process
- Maintain pattern library with validation

**Benefits**:
- Consistent AI behavior
- Higher quality outputs
- Reduced cognitive load

## Schema Design {#schema-design}

**Lesson**: Research-based schema design produces more robust and validated solutions.
