# System Service Guide

> DEPRECATED: Content integrated into core guides â€” see `400_guides/400_11_deployments-ops-and-observability.md` (services, health/readiness, monitoring), `400_guides/400_09_automation-and-pipelines.md` (scripts/CI wiring), `400_guides/400_08_integrations-editor-and-models.md` (dashboards/integration touchpoints), and `400_guides/400_00_getting-started-and-index.md` (index). Implementation lives under `src/` and `dashboard/`.

## TL;DR

- Run background processing as a long-lived service.
- Provides health/readiness endpoints and monitoring.
- Integrates with mission dashboard and retry logic.

## Overview

This guide explains running the RAG pipeline components as system services (local dev or containerized).

## Starting Services

- Dashboard: `python3 src/dashboard.py`
- Mission dashboard: `./start_mission_dashboard.sh`
- Watch folder: `./start_watch_folder.sh`

## Health & Monitoring

- Health endpoints: `/health`, `/ready`
- Metrics: `/api/monitoring` (production metrics and security events)

## Reliability

- Central retry wrapper with exponential backoff
- Connection pooling for the vector store

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure environment variables and DB connectivity
- Check logs for failed retries and circuit-breaker events
