- Add clear "auto-generated" banner
- Ensure all metadata is properly displayed

## Phase 2: Closure and Scribe Integration (Weeks 3-4)

### Task 2.1: Implement Automated PRD Closure Process
**Description**: Create automated process for closing completed PRDs with proper validation and archiving.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Closure process validates all tasks are complete
- [ ] Closure process validates tests pass
- [ ] Closure process requires clean Git working directory
- [ ] Closure process updates JSON and regenerates markdown

**Implementation Notes**:
- Integrate with existing task completion tracking
- Add test validation (JSON report presence/validation)
- Force Git commit before closure
- Update item status to "done" in JSON

### Task 2.2: Create Scribe Pack Generation System
**Description**: Implement system to generate Scribe packs for knowledge mining from completed items.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Scribe packs include all relevant artifacts
- [ ] Packs are properly structured and documented
- [ ] Packs include lessons learned template
- [ ] Packs are placed in correct location

**Implementation Notes**:
- Create structured pack format with manifest
- Include PRD, tasks, test reports, and lessons learned
- Generate summary metadata for analysis
- Place packs in `/scribe_inbox/` directory

### Task 2.3: Add Archive Discipline for Completed Items
**Description**: Implement systematic archiving of completed items with proper organization.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Completed items are moved to archive location
- [ ] Archive maintains proper organization
- [ ] Archived items are marked as deprecated
- [ ] Archive is searchable and accessible

**Implementation Notes**:
- Move completed PRDs to `/600_archives/` directory
- Add "DEPRECATED" banner to archived files
- Maintain cross-references and links
- Ensure archive is Git-tracked

### Task 2.4: Integrate with Existing Scribe System
**Description**: Ensure new Scribe packs integrate properly with existing knowledge mining system.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Scribe packs are compatible with existing system
- [ ] Knowledge mining works with new pack format
- [ ] Integration maintains existing functionality
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing Scribe system

**Implementation Notes**:
- Review existing Scribe system requirements
- Ensure pack format compatibility
- Test integration with existing tools
- Update documentation as needed

## Phase 3: Knowledge Mining and Optimization (Weeks 5-6)

### Task 3.1: Implement Knowledge Mining from Scribe Packs
**Description**: Create system to extract and analyze knowledge from completed Scribe packs.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] System can analyze completed items for patterns
- [ ] System extracts lessons learned and insights
- [ ] System provides actionable recommendations
- [ ] System integrates with existing knowledge base

**Implementation Notes**:
- Analyze Scribe packs for common patterns
- Extract lessons learned and best practices
- Generate insights for future planning
- Integrate with existing documentation system

### Task 3.2: Add Analytics and Insights Capabilities
**Description**: Implement analytics and insights capabilities for backlog data.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] System provides backlog analytics and metrics

- [ ] System generates insights for improvement
- [ ] Analytics are accessible via CLI or reports

**Implementation Notes**:
- Track completion rates and cycle times
- Identify bottlenecks and dependencies

- Provide actionable insights for planning

### Task 3.3: Optimize Performance and Usability
**Description**: Optimize system performance and improve usability based on testing and feedback.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] System responds to queries in <1 second
- [ ] CLI tools are intuitive and easy to use
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive and accurate

**Implementation Notes**:
- Profile and optimize performance bottlenecks

## Success Criteria

- **Data Integrity**: 100% of backlog data passes validation
- **Tool Usability**: CLI tools handle 90% of common operations
- **Knowledge Capture**: 100% of completed items generate Scribe packs
- **Human Readability**: Generated markdown maintains readability standards
- **Performance**: System responds to queries in <1 second

## Dependencies

- **B-1006-A**: DSPy 3.0 Core Parity Migration (completed)
