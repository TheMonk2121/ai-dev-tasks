## 1. Problem Statement

**What's broken?** The current system uses DSPy 2.6.27 with a sophisticated custom assertion framework and optimization components. While this implementation is advanced, it's missing native DSPy 3.0 features that could significantly improve system capabilities and reduce maintenance overhead.

**Why does it matter?** DSPy 3.0 introduces native assertion support (`dspy.Assert`, `@dspy.assert_transform_module`), enhanced optimization capabilities, MLflow integration, and improved fine-tuning support. These features would eliminate the need for custom assertion frameworks and provide better optimization techniques.

**What's the opportunity?** By migrating to DSPy 3.0, we can:
- Replace custom assertion framework with native `dspy.Assert` support
- Leverage enhanced optimization capabilities for better performance
- Integrate MLflow for improved experiment tracking and model management
- Access new reinforcement learning and fine-tuning features
- Future-proof the system with the latest framework capabilities
- **Schema compatibility confirmed** - existing signatures and field definitions work identically in DSPy 3.0

## 2. Solution Overview

**What are we building?** A comprehensive migration from DSPy 2.6.27 to DSPy 3.0 that preserves all existing advanced custom features while leveraging new native capabilities.

**How does it work?** The migration will follow a phased approach:
1. **Test Environment Setup**: Create isolated test environment with DSPy 3.0
2. **Compatibility Validation**: Test all existing modules and components
3. **Native Feature Integration**: Replace custom assertions with native DSPy 3.0 assertions
4. **Enhanced Optimization**: Integrate new optimization capabilities
5. **MLflow Integration**: Add experiment tracking and model management
6. **Production Deployment**: Gradual rollout with rollback capabilities

**What are the key features?**
- Native assertion support replacing custom framework
- Enhanced optimization with new DSPy 3.0 optimizers
- MLflow integration for experiment tracking
- Improved fine-tuning and reinforcement learning support
- Backward compatibility with existing custom components

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

**How do we know it's done?**
- All existing DSPy modules work with DSPy 3.0 without modification
- Custom assertion framework successfully replaced with native `dspy.Assert`
- Enhanced optimization capabilities integrated and tested
- MLflow integration provides experiment tracking
- Performance metrics show improvement or maintain current levels
- All tests pass with DSPy 3.0

**What does success look like?**
- System successfully migrates to DSPy 3.0 with zero downtime
- Native assertion support reduces code complexity by 30%
- Enhanced optimization improves performance by 15-25%
- MLflow integration provides comprehensive experiment tracking
- All existing advanced features remain functional

**What are the quality gates?**
- All existing tests must pass with DSPy 3.0
- Performance benchmarks must meet or exceed current levels
- Custom assertion framework must be fully replaced
- MLflow integration must be functional
- Rollback capability must be tested and verified

## 4. Technical Approach

**What technology?**
- DSPy 3.0 (upgrade from 2.6.27)
- MLflow for experiment tracking
- Enhanced optimization techniques
- Native assertion framework
- Existing custom components (preserved)

**How does it integrate?**
- Maintains compatibility with existing ModelSwitcher, optimization loop, and metrics dashboard
- Integrates with current PostgreSQL + PGVector infrastructure
- Preserves Cursor AI integration and local model support
- Maintains existing role refinement and system integration components

**What are the constraints?**
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing custom features
- Hardware constraints (M4 Mac, 128GB RAM) remain unchanged
- Local model integration (Ollama) must continue working
- Zero downtime migration requirement
- **Schema compatibility** - existing signatures and field definitions are fully compatible with DSPy 3.0

## 5. Risks and Mitigation

**What could go wrong?**
- Breaking changes in DSPy 3.0 API that affect existing modules
- Performance regression with new optimization techniques
- MLflow integration complexity and overhead
- Custom assertion framework replacement complexity
- **Schema compatibility risk** - Minimal risk confirmed through analysis of existing signatures

**How do we handle it?**
- Comprehensive testing in isolated environment before production
- Gradual migration with rollback capabilities at each phase
- Performance benchmarking at each step
- Maintain custom assertion framework as fallback during transition

**What are the unknowns?**
- Exact DSPy 3.0 API changes and breaking changes
- Performance impact of new optimization techniques
- MLflow integration complexity and learning curve
- Compatibility with existing local model setup

## 6. Testing Strategy

**What needs testing?**
- All existing DSPy modules and components
- Custom assertion framework replacement
- Enhanced optimization capabilities
- MLflow integration functionality
- Performance benchmarks and metrics
- Rollback procedures

**How do we test it?**
- Comprehensive test suite with DSPy 3.0
- Performance benchmarking against current system
- Integration testing with existing components
- End-to-end testing of complete workflows
- Stress testing with production-like loads

**What's the coverage target?**
- 100% test coverage for all DSPy modules
- Performance benchmarks within 5% of current levels
- All existing functionality must work without modification
- Rollback procedures tested and verified
