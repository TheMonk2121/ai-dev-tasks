# Product Requirements Document: B-1006 - DSPy 3.0 Migration (Simplified)

> **Simplified Migration**: Focus on core DSPy 3.0 upgrade without overengineering

## 1. Problem Statement

**What's broken?** The current system uses DSPy 2.6.27. DSPy 3.0 is available with native assertion support and improved features.

**Why does it matter?** DSPy 3.0 introduces native assertion support (`dspy.Assert`, `@dspy.assert_transform_module`) and other improvements that could replace our custom assertion framework.

**What's the opportunity?** Simple migration to DSPy 3.0 to:
- Use native `dspy.Assert` instead of custom assertion framework
- Get latest DSPy features and improvements
- Future-proof the system

## 2. Solution Overview

**What are we building?** A simple migration from DSPy 2.6.27 to DSPy 3.0.

**How does it work?**
1. **Upgrade DSPy**: Pin DSPy 3.0.1 in requirements.txt
2. **Test Compatibility**: Run existing tests to ensure nothing breaks
3. **Replace Custom Assertions**: Use native `dspy.Assert` where possible
4. **Validate**: Ensure system works as expected

**What are the key features?**
- Native assertion support replacing custom framework where beneficial
- Latest DSPy features and improvements
- Backward compatibility with existing components

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

**How do we know it's done?**
- DSPy 3.0.1 successfully installed and working
- All existing tests pass
- System functionality unchanged
- Native assertions used where they make sense

**What does success look like?**
- System successfully uses DSPy 3.0
- No functionality lost
- Code is cleaner where native assertions replace custom ones

**What are the quality gates?**
- All existing tests must pass
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
