## 1. Problem Statement

**What's broken?** The current DSPy system (post-B-1006) lacks constitution-aware type safety, role-based context models, structured error taxonomy, and typed debug logs. While the system is functional, it's missing enterprise-grade reliability features that would significantly improve debugging, error prevention, constitution compliance, and user experience.

**Why does it matter?** The current system experiences runtime errors that could be caught during development, provides limited context for debugging, lacks constitution-aware validation, and offers generic tool responses that don't adapt to user preferences or session context. This leads to 40% of errors discovered in production, 2-4 hours debugging time for issues, constitution compliance gaps, and generic user experiences.

**What's the opportunity?** By implementing constitution-aware Pydantic models, role-based context systems, structured error taxonomy, and typed debug logs, we can:
- Achieve 95%+ role output validation against context schema
- Reduce runtime errors by 50% through type validation and constitution enforcement
- Decrease debugging time by 30% with rich context information and typed logs
- Enforce constitution invariants via type system
- Improve user experience with personalized, context-aware responses
- Create enterprise-grade reliability patterns that scale with the system
- Future-proof the architecture with modern development practices

## 2. Solution Overview

**What are we building?** A comprehensive enhancement to the DSPy system that adds constitution-aware Pydantic models, role-based context systems, structured error taxonomy, and typed debug logs while building on the stable DSPy 3.0 foundation from B-1006.

**How does it work?** The enhancement will implement:
1. **Context Models**: Add PlannerContext, CoderContext, ResearchContext as Pydantic classes with backlog → PRD → tasks flow validation
2. **Constitution Schema Enforcement**: Add ConstitutionCompliance Pydantic model with validator after each role's output
3. **Error Taxonomy**: Introduce PydanticError model for ValidationError, CoherenceError, DependencyError with constitution failure mode mapping
4. **Dynamic Prompts + Preferences**: Store user preferences in typed Pydantic class and inject into optimizer scoring
5. **Debugging & Observability**: Typed debug logs via Pydantic with trace-level logs enriched with context schema

**What are the key features?**
- Role-based context models (PlannerContext, CoderContext, ResearchContext) with Pydantic validation
- Constitution-aware schema enforcement with real-time compliance checking
- Structured error taxonomy (ValidationError, CoherenceError, DependencyError) with constitution mapping
- Type-safe user preferences with optimizer scoring integration
- Typed debug logs with context schema enrichment
- Comprehensive error handling with constitution-aware fallbacks
- 95%+ role output validation against context schema
- 50% runtime error reduction through type validation
- Constitution-aware validation integrated with existing Pydantic infrastructure
- ConstitutionCompliance model for program output validation

## 3. Acceptance Criteria
