## 1. Problem Statement

**What's broken?** The current DSPy system (post-B-1006) lacks constitution-aware type safety, role-based context models, structured error taxonomy, typed debug logs, and async Pydantic validation. While the system is functional, it's missing enterprise-grade reliability features that would significantly improve debugging, error prevention, constitution compliance, user experience, and I/O performance.

**Why does it matter?** The current system experiences runtime errors that could be caught during development, provides limited context for debugging, lacks constitution-aware validation, offers generic tool responses that don't adapt to user preferences or session context, and has I/O performance bottlenecks. This leads to 40% of errors discovered in production, 2-4 hours debugging time for issues, constitution compliance gaps, generic user experiences, and 60% slower I/O operations.

**What's the opportunity?** By implementing constitution-aware Pydantic models, role-based context systems, structured error taxonomy, typed debug logs, and async Pydantic validation, we can:
- Achieve 95%+ role output validation against context schema
- Reduce runtime errors by 50% through type validation and constitution enforcement
- Decrease debugging time by 30% with rich context information and typed logs
- Enforce constitution invariants via type system
- Improve user experience with personalized, context-aware responses
- Create enterprise-grade reliability patterns that scale with the system
- Achieve 60% I/O performance improvement through async Pydantic validation
- Future-proof the architecture with modern development practices

## 2. Solution Overview

**What are we building?** A lean, solo-dev-optimized enhancement to the DSPy system that adds typed context models, structured error taxonomy, and user preferences while building on the stable DSPy 3.0 foundation from B-1006.

**How does it work?** The enhancement will implement:
1. **Context Models**: Add PlannerContext, CoderContext as Pydantic classes with backlog → PRD → tasks flow validation
2. **Error Taxonomy**: Introduce PydanticError model for ValidationError, CoherenceError, DependencyError with constitution failure mode mapping
3. **Dynamic Prompts + Preferences**: Store user preferences in local JSON file and inject into optimizer scoring
4. **Debugging & Observability**: Typed debug logs via Pydantic with context schema enrichment
5. **Integration**: Explicit function calls (no decorators) integrated with existing memory rehydrator

**What are the key features?**
- Role-based context models (PlannerContext, CoderContext) with Pydantic validation
- Structured error taxonomy (ValidationError, CoherenceError, DependencyError) with constitution mapping
- Type-safe user preferences stored in local JSON file with optimizer scoring integration
- Typed debug logs with context schema enrichment
- Explicit function calls (no decorators) for clarity and debugging
- Integration with existing memory rehydrator and DSPy infrastructure
- 95%+ role output validation against context schema
- 50% runtime error reduction through type validation
- Constitution-aware validation integrated with existing Pydantic infrastructure
- Local-first approach with no database dependencies
- Performance impact <3% overhead with <100ms prompt generation

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

- Integrates with existing memory rehydrator and DSPy infrastructure
- Enhances current tool ecosystem with context awareness
- Maintains compatibility with Cursor AI and local model integration
- Uses explicit function calls for clarity and debugging

**What are the constraints?**
