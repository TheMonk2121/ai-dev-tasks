## 1. Problem Statement

**What's broken?** - Current AI conversations lack persistent memory across sessions, requiring users to re-explain context, preferences, and previous work. The existing memory rehydration system provides good context but doesn't maintain conversation continuity like ChatGPT's LTST memory.

**Why does it matter?** - Users lose productivity when AI agents can't remember previous conversations, project context, or user preferences. This creates friction in the development workflow and reduces the effectiveness of the AI development ecosystem.

**What's the opportunity?** - Implement ChatGPT-like LTST memory to create seamless conversation continuity, improve user experience, and enable more sophisticated AI interactions that build on previous context.

## 2. Solution Overview

**What are we building?** - A Long-Term Short-Term memory system that persists conversation context, user preferences, and project state across AI sessions while maintaining the existing memory rehydration capabilities.

**How does it work?** - Extend the existing PostgreSQL + pgvector infrastructure to store conversation history, session metadata, and context relationships. Implement automatic memory merging and retrieval based on conversation relevance and user patterns.

**What are the key features?** - Conversation persistence, session tracking, context merging, automatic memory rehydration, user preference learning, and seamless integration with existing DSPy optimization pipeline.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

**How do we know it's done?** -
- [ ] Conversations persist across sessions with 95% context retention
- [ ] Memory rehydration includes conversation history in <5 seconds
- [ ] User preferences are learned and applied automatically
- [ ] Session tracking provides conversation continuity
- [ ] Integration with existing DSPy system maintains performance

**What does success look like?** - Users can resume conversations seamlessly, AI remembers project context and user preferences, and the system provides ChatGPT-like conversation continuity without performance degradation.

**What are the quality gates?** -
- [ ] All existing memory rehydration tests pass
- [ ] New conversation persistence tests pass
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained (<5s rehydration)
- [ ] Database schema migrations complete successfully
- [ ] Integration tests with DSPy system pass

## 4. Technical Approach

**What technology?** - PostgreSQL + pgvector for storage, existing memory rehydration infrastructure, new conversation schema, session management system, and context merging algorithms.

**How does it integrate?** - Extends existing `memory_rehydrator.py`, adds conversation tables to database schema, integrates with session registry, and maintains compatibility with current DSPy optimization pipeline.

**What are the constraints?** - Must maintain existing performance (<5s rehydration), preserve all current functionality, use existing database infrastructure, and avoid breaking changes to current API.

## 5. Risks and Mitigation

**What could go wrong?** -
- Performance degradation from additional database queries
- Schema migration issues affecting existing data
- Memory bloat from storing too much conversation history
- Integration conflicts with existing DSPy system

**How do we handle it?** -
- Implement query optimization and caching strategies
- Use safe database migrations with rollback capability
- Add conversation history limits and cleanup policies
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing APIs

**What are the unknowns?** - Optimal conversation history retention period, memory merging algorithm effectiveness, and user preference learning accuracy.

## 6. Testing Strategy

**What needs testing?** -
- Conversation persistence across sessions
- Memory rehydration with conversation history
- Performance benchmarks and optimization
- Database schema migrations
- Integration with existing systems

**How do we test it?** -
- Unit tests for conversation storage and retrieval
- Integration tests with memory rehydration system
- Performance tests with realistic conversation loads
- Database migration tests with rollback procedures
- End-to-end tests with DSPy integration

**What's the coverage target?** - 90% code coverage for new functionality, 100% coverage for critical conversation persistence logic.

## 7. Implementation Plan

**What are the phases?** -
1. Database schema design and migration
2. Conversation storage and retrieval implementation
3. Session tracking and context merging
4. Integration with memory rehydration system
5. Performance optimization and testing
6. User preference learning implementation

**What are the dependencies?** -
- B-1006-A DSPy 3.0 Core Parity Migration (completed)
- Existing memory rehydration infrastructure
- PostgreSQL + pgvector database system

**What's the timeline?** - 5 points = approximately 8-10 hours of development time across 2-3 days.
