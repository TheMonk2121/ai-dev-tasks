# PRD-Backlog Linkage Rules

## Required PRD Header Format

When creating or updating PRDs, always include the enhanced header format with complete dependency and impact information:

```markdown
# PRD: [Title]

**Backlog Item**: B-XXX
**Status**: [Ready for Implementation | In Progress | Completed]
**Estimated Hours**: X hours

**Dependencies**:
- **Upstream**: [Items that must be completed first]
- **Downstream**: [Items that depend on this completion]
- **Blocking**: [Items that block this implementation]

**Impact Scope**:
- **Direct**: [Immediate changes required]
- **Indirect**: [Systems/components affected]
- **Public Contracts**: [APIs, schemas, interfaces changed]

## TL;DR
```

## Enforcement Rules

1. **Every PRD must reference its backlog item** in the header
2. **Every backlog item with PRD must reference the PRD file** in metadata
3. **Status must be synchronized** between backlog and PRD
4. **Dependencies must be clearly documented** (upstream, downstream, blocking)
5. **Impact scope must be defined** (direct, indirect, public contracts)
6. **Run validation script** after creating/updating PRDs: `python3 scripts/validate_prd_backlog_linkage.py`

## Validation

Always run the PRD-backlog linkage validator to ensure compliance with these standards.
