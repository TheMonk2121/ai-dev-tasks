# PRD-Documentation Alignment Rule

## When PRDs and Core Documentation Don't Align

**CRITICAL RULE**: When implementing features from PRDs, if the PRD specifies file locations or structures that conflict with established project conventions (as documented in `400_guides/400_documentation-guide.md` and `200_setup/200_naming-conventions.md`), you MUST:

1. **STOP** implementation immediately
2. **IDENTIFY** the specific conflict (e.g., PRD says `docs/` but conventions say `000_core/`)
3. **EXPLAIN** the conflict to the user with clear reasoning
4. **WAIT** for user decision on which approach to follow
5. **DOCUMENT** the decision for future reference

## Examples of Conflicts to Watch For

- PRD specifies `docs/004_bugfix_playbook.md` but conventions show workflows belong in `000_core/`
- PRD suggests file naming that doesn't follow the 000-999 prefix system
- PRD references directory structures that don't match established patterns
- PRD calls for documentation locations that conflict with the documented hierarchy

## Why This Matters

- Prevents breaking established project conventions
- Maintains consistency across the codebase
- Avoids confusion for future developers and AI assistants
- Ensures documentation remains discoverable and well-organized

## Implementation

When you encounter such conflicts:
1. Show the user both the PRD specification and the established convention
2. Explain the pros/cons of each approach
3. Ask for explicit direction on which to follow
4. Only proceed after receiving clear guidance

This rule takes precedence over "following PRD exactly" when there are clear conflicts with established project standards.
