# Linting Configuration Guidelines

## Linting Principles
- Focus on critical, high-impact issues
- Avoid blocking development with excessive warnings
- Prioritize code readability and functionality

## Recommended Approach
- Use minimal, targeted linting
- Manually review and address critical warnings
- Gradually increase linting strictness as project matures

## Temporary Linting Suspension
- Linting is currently suspended to reduce noise
- Periodically re-enable and review linter output
- Incrementally address any critical issues

## Best Practices
- Manually run linters before commits
- Use type hints and clear code structure
- Prioritize code clarity over strict rule adherence
