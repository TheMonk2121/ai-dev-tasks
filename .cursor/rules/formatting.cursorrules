# Formatting Rules

## Markdown Output Rules

- Do not emit bracketed placeholders in Markdown (e.g., `[Describe the purpose ...]`, `[Owner ...]`). These can be parsed as link references and break rendering.
- Use plain text prompts instead, e.g., `Describe the purpose and scope of this document`.
- If emphasis is needed, prefer backticks or blockquotes, not square brackets.

## Documentation Standards

- All documentation must follow markdown standards
- Each document must have a single h1 title matching filename
- TL;DR section required at top of core docs
- Cross-references must be maintained between related files
- Documentation hierarchy: 000-099 (core), 100-199 (guides), etc.
