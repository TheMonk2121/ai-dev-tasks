```

### Development Patterns
- **Add backlog item**: `scripts/backlog_intake.py` → update `000_core/000_backlog.md`
- **Generate PRD**: `scripts/prd_generator.py` → create `PRD-B-XXX.md`
- **Generate tasks**: `scripts/task_generator.py` → create `Task-List-B-XXX.md`
- **Execute workflow**: `scripts/single_doorway.py` → automated 001-003 flow
- **Update memory**: `scripts/update_cursor_memory.py` → maintain context

### Local Development
```bash
# Setup
poetry install
poetry run pre-commit install

# Quality gates
poetry run pytest              # Run tests
poetry run black .             # Format code
poetry run ruff check .        # Lint code
poetry run mypy .              # Type check

# Backlog operations
python3 scripts/backlog_cli.py add "description"  # Add item
python3 scripts/backlog_cli.py update B-XXX       # Update item
python3 scripts/backlog_cli.py close B-XXX        # Close item
```

### Common Tasks Cheat Sheet
- **Add new feature**: Backlog intake → PRD → Tasks → Execute → Archive
- **Fix bug**: Identify → Backlog item → Quick PRD → Execute → Close
- **Refactor system**: Analysis → Backlog item → Comprehensive PRD → Phased execution
- **Update documentation**: Direct edit → Update memory → Validate coherence

## 1. Problem Statement

**What's broken?** The current backlog system uses markdown (`000_backlog.md`) as the source of truth, which creates several critical issues: lack of structured data capabilities, inconsistent completion tracking, no systematic knowledge mining from completed items, and difficulty in programmatic access for automation and analysis. Additionally, the system lacks industry-standard prioritization methods (MoSCoW), visual interfaces for solo developers, and dynamic reprioritization capabilities.

**Why does it matter?** The backlog is the central planning and execution hub for the AI development ecosystem. Without structured data, we can't build proper automation, track dependencies effectively, or mine knowledge from completed work. As a solo developer, I need streamlined workflows, visual interfaces, and intelligent prioritization to maximize productivity and maintain focus on high-impact work.

**What's the opportunity?** Implementing an enhanced backlog system that combines industry best practices (MoSCoW prioritization, visual Kanban, dynamic reprioritization) with solo developer optimizations (one-command workflows, context preservation, auto-advance) will provide structured data capabilities while dramatically improving the development experience.

## 2. Solution Overview

**What are we building?** An enhanced backlog system that combines structured JSON data with industry-standard prioritization methods and solo developer optimizations. The system includes MoSCoW prioritization, visual Kanban interface, dynamic reprioritization, one-command workflows, and comprehensive knowledge mining.

**How does it work?** The system will:
1. **Hybrid JSON + Markdown**: Use `backlog.json` for structured data, generate `000_backlog.md` for readability
2. **MoSCoW Prioritization**: Implement Must/Should/Could/Won't categorization with visual indicators
3. **Visual Kanban Interface**: NiceGUI-based dashboard with drag-and-drop prioritization
4. **Dynamic Reprioritization**: AI-driven priority adjustments based on completion patterns and context
5. **Solo-Optimized Workflows**: One-command operations with auto-advance and context preservation
6. **Knowledge Mining**: Automated Scribe pack generation and insights extraction

**Key Components**:
- **backlog.json**: Single source of truth with MoSCoW prioritization
- **Visual Dashboard**: NiceGUI Kanban board with real-time updates
- **Solo Workflow CLI**: One-command operations for common tasks
- **Dynamic Prioritization**: AI-driven priority adjustments
- **Scribe Integration**: Automated knowledge mining and pack generation
- **Archive System**: Systematic organization with insights extraction

**What are the key features?**
1. **Structured Data**: JSON schema with MoSCoW prioritization
2. **Visual Interface**: Kanban board with drag-and-drop
3. **Solo Optimization**: One-command workflows with auto-advance
4. **Dynamic Intelligence**: AI-driven reprioritization
5. **Knowledge Mining**: Automated insights from completed work
6. **Industry Standards**: MoSCoW, Kanban, CI/CD integration
7. **Context Preservation**: LTST memory integration

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

**How do we know it's done?**
- [ ] `backlog.json` serves as single source of truth with MoSCoW prioritization
- [ ] Visual Kanban dashboard displays backlog items with drag-and-drop
