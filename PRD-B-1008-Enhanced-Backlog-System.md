## 1. Problem Statement

**What's broken?** The current backlog system uses markdown (`000_backlog.md`) as the source of truth, which creates several critical issues: lack of structured data capabilities, inconsistent completion tracking, no systematic knowledge mining from completed items, and difficulty in programmatic access for automation and analysis.

**Why does it matter?** The backlog is the central planning and execution hub for the AI development ecosystem. Without structured data, we can't build proper automation, track dependencies effectively, or mine knowledge from completed work. This limits our ability to improve processes and make data-driven decisions.

**What's the opportunity?** Implementing a hybrid JSON-based backlog system will provide structured data capabilities while maintaining human readability and version control. This enables automated PRD closure with Scribe packs, systematic knowledge mining, and better integration with the existing AI development ecosystem.

## 2. Solution Overview

**What are we building?** A hybrid JSON-based backlog system that uses structured data as the source of truth while maintaining human readability and simple tooling. The system includes validation hooks, simple CLI tools, automated PRD closure with Scribe packs, and knowledge mining capabilities.

**How does it work?** The system will:
1. **JSON as Source of Truth**: Use `backlog.json` for structured data storage
2. **Validation Hooks**: Ensure data integrity and consistency
3. **Simple CLI Tools**: Provide easy-to-use tools for common operations
4. **Automated Closure**: Generate Scribe packs for knowledge mining
5. **Markdown Generation**: Create human-readable `000_backlog.md` from JSON

**Key Components**:
- **backlog.json**: Single source of truth with structured schema
- **Validation Hooks**: Pre-commit and runtime validation
- **Simple CLI Tools**: Add, update, close, and query backlog items
- **Scribe Pack System**: Automated knowledge extraction from completed items
- **Archive Discipline**: Systematic organization of completed work

**What are the key features?**
1. **Structured Data**: JSON schema with proper validation
2. **Simple Tools**: Easy-to-use CLI for common operations
3. **Validation Hooks**: Ensure data integrity and consistency
4. **Scribe Packs**: Automated knowledge mining from completed items
5. **Archive Discipline**: Systematic organization of completed work
6. **Version Control**: Full Git integration with validation
7. **Human Readable**: Generated markdown for easy reading

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

**How do we know it's done?**
- [ ] `backlog.json` serves as the single source of truth for all backlog data
- [ ] Validation hooks prevent invalid data from being committed
- [ ] Simple CLI tools work for add, update, close, and query operations
- [ ] Scribe packs are automatically generated for completed items
- [ ] `000_backlog.md` is generated from JSON and marked as read-only
- [ ] Archive system organizes completed items systematically
- [ ] Knowledge mining provides insights for future planning

**What does success look like?**
- Backlog system provides structured data capabilities without complexity
- Simple tools enable efficient backlog management
- Automated closure process captures knowledge systematically
- Human readability is maintained through generated markdown
- Version control integration ensures data integrity

**What are the quality gates?**
- All JSON data must pass schema validation
- CLI tools must handle all common operations without errors
- Scribe packs must be generated for all completed items
- Generated markdown must be human-readable and accurate
- Archive system must organize items without data loss

## 4. Technical Approach

**What technology?** Build on existing infrastructure:
- **JSON Schema**: Define structured data format with validation
- **Python Scripts**: Simple CLI tools for common operations
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit validation and post-commit actions
- **Scribe Integration**: Leverage existing Scribe system for knowledge mining
- **Markdown Generation**: Simple templating for human-readable output

**How does it integrate?**
- **Existing Workflow**: Maintain compatibility with current 001-003 workflow
- **Scribe System**: Integrate with existing knowledge mining capabilities
- **Version Control**: Full Git integration with validation hooks
- **Documentation**: Update guides to reflect new system

**What are the constraints?**
- Must maintain human readability and version control
- Must integrate with existing AI development ecosystem
- Must be simple enough for solo developer workflow
- Must not add significant complexity or dependencies

## 5. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: JSON Schema and Basic Tools (Weeks 1-2)
- Define JSON schema for backlog items
- Create simple CLI tools for add/update/query
- Implement basic validation hooks
- Generate markdown from JSON

### Phase 2: Closure and Scribe Integration (Weeks 3-4)
- Implement automated PRD closure process
- Create Scribe pack generation system
- Add archive discipline for completed items
- Integrate with existing Scribe system

### Phase 3: Knowledge Mining and Optimization (Weeks 5-6)
- Implement knowledge mining from Scribe packs
- Add analytics and insights capabilities
- Optimize performance and usability
- Complete documentation and testing

## 6. Success Metrics

- **Data Integrity**: 100% of backlog data passes validation
- **Tool Usability**: CLI tools handle 90% of common operations
- **Knowledge Capture**: 100% of completed items generate Scribe packs
- **Human Readability**: Generated markdown maintains readability standards
- **Performance**: System responds to queries in <1 second

## 7. Risks and Mitigation

**Risk**: JSON complexity could make simple edits harder
**Mitigation**: Provide simple CLI tools and maintain markdown generation

**Risk**: Validation hooks could slow down development workflow
**Mitigation**: Optimize validation performance and provide bypass options

**Risk**: Scribe pack generation could fail silently
**Mitigation**: Add comprehensive error handling and monitoring

## 8. Dependencies

- **B-1006-A**: DSPy 3.0 Core Parity Migration (completed)
- **B-1007**: Pydantic AI Style Enhancements (next priority)
- **Existing Scribe System**: For knowledge mining integration
- **Git Infrastructure**: For version control and hooks

## 9. Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Analytics**: Deeper insights from backlog data
- **Integration APIs**: Programmatic access for external tools
- **Machine Learning**: Predictive analytics for backlog planning
- **Collaboration Features**: Multi-user support if needed
