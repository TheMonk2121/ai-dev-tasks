## 1. Problem Statement

**What's broken?** The current backlog system doesn't leverage the sophisticated DSPy 3.0 native assertions or Pydantic type validation capabilities that will be available after B-1006 and B-1007 completion. The backlog scoring is static and doesn't account for dependency chains, risk factors, framework migration value, automated context complexity analysis, and lacks automated organization logic for item placement.

**Why does it matter?** Without enhanced backlog capabilities, the system misses opportunities to:
- Prioritize dependency chains that unlock high-value work (like B-1006 → B-1007)
- Account for risk-adjusted scoring when compatibility is confirmed
- Capture framework migration strategic value
- Automate context complexity analysis for better task sizing
- Integrate with the memory rehydration system for context-aware prioritization
- Automatically organize and place new backlog items in the correct position
- Eliminate manual placement decisions and reduce cognitive overhead

**What's the opportunity?** By leveraging DSPy 3.0 and Pydantic capabilities, we can create an intelligent backlog system that:
- Automatically calculates dependency chain value bonuses
- Applies risk multipliers for confirmed compatibility
- Captures framework migration strategic importance
- Provides automated context complexity analysis
- Integrates with memory rehydration for context-aware scoring
- Automatically organizes and places new items using intelligent insertion logic
- Maintains consistent ordering based on ID, priority, score, and dependencies

## 2. Solution Overview

**What are we building?** An enhanced backlog system that leverages DSPy 3.0 native assertions and Pydantic type validation to provide intelligent scoring, automated dependency analysis, risk-adjusted prioritization, and context-aware task generation.

**How does it work?** The enhanced system will:
1. **Dependency Chain Analysis**: Use DSPy 3.0 assertions to validate dependency relationships and calculate chain value bonuses
2. **Risk-Adjusted Scoring**: Apply Pydantic validation to assess risk factors and adjust scores accordingly
3. **Framework Migration Recognition**: Automatically identify and weight strategic framework upgrades
4. **Context Complexity Analysis**: Use memory rehydration integration to assess context complexity
5. **Automated Scoring Updates**: Continuously update scores based on changing dependencies and context

**What are the key features?**
- Enhanced scoring formula with dependency chain bonuses
- Risk-adjusted scoring with Pydantic validation
- Framework migration value recognition
- Automated context complexity analysis
- Memory rehydration integration
- Real-time scoring updates
- Automated backlog organization and item placement
- Intelligent insertion logic based on ID, priority, and dependencies

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

**How do we know it's done?**
- Enhanced scoring formula implemented with dependency chain bonuses
- Risk-adjusted scoring system operational with Pydantic validation
- Framework migration recognition working for strategic upgrades
- Automated context complexity analysis integrated
- Memory rehydration system integration complete
- Automated backlog organization system operational
- All existing backlog items updated with enhanced scoring
- New items automatically placed in correct position

**What does success look like?**
- B-1006 gets higher priority due to low risk (confirmed compatibility) and chain value (unlocks B-1007)
- Dependency chains are automatically identified and weighted
- Context complexity is automatically assessed for task sizing
- Risk factors are validated using Pydantic type checking
- Memory rehydration integration provides context-aware prioritization
- New backlog items are automatically placed in the correct position
- Manual placement decisions are eliminated
- Consistent ordering is maintained across all backlog items

**What are the quality gates?**
- All existing backlog items maintain their current priority order
- Enhanced scoring provides measurable improvements in prioritization
- Dependency chain analysis correctly identifies B-1006 → B-1007 relationship
- Risk-adjusted scoring correctly identifies low-risk migrations
- Automated organization correctly places new items
- Performance impact is minimal (<5% overhead)
