## 1. Problem Statement

**What's broken?** The current backlog system doesn't leverage constitution-aware scoring, cross-role dependency detection, real-time updates, automated migration with metadata preservation, specific performance targets, and async real-time scoring updates. The backlog scoring is static and doesn't account for constitution article weighting, cross-role dependencies (Planner → Coder → Reviewer), real-time n8n integration, lacks automated migration with 100% metadata preservation, and has I/O performance bottlenecks for real-time updates.

**Why does it matter?** Without enhanced backlog capabilities, the system misses opportunities to:
- Weight items by constitution articles (workflow chain, context preservation)
- Detect cross-role dependencies (Planner → Coder → Reviewer)
- Integrate real-time updates with n8n scrubber for auto-scoring refresh
- Preserve 100% of constitution-linked metadata during migration
- Validate migration outputs via ConstitutionCompliance model
- Achieve <5% performance overhead on real-time scoring updates
- Provide async real-time scoring updates with 60% I/O performance improvement
- Automatically organize and place new backlog items in the correct position
- Eliminate manual placement decisions and reduce cognitive overhead

**What's the opportunity?** By leveraging constitution-aware scoring and real-time updates, we can create an intelligent backlog system that:
- Automatically calculates dependency bonuses and risk-adjusted scoring
- Weights items by constitution articles (workflow chain, context preservation)
- Detects cross-role dependencies (Planner → Coder → Reviewer)
- Integrates real-time updates with n8n scrubber for auto-scoring refresh
- Preserves 100% of constitution-linked metadata during migration
- Validates migration outputs via ConstitutionCompliance model
- Achieves <5% performance overhead on real-time scoring updates
- Provides async real-time scoring updates with 60% I/O performance improvement
- Automatically organizes and places new items using intelligent insertion logic
- Maintains consistent ordering based on ID, priority, score, and dependencies

## 2. Solution Overview

**What are we building?** An enhanced backlog system that leverages constitution-aware scoring, cross-role dependency detection, real-time n8n integration, and automated migration with 100% metadata preservation to provide intelligent scoring, automated dependency analysis, risk-adjusted prioritization, and context-aware task generation.

**How does it work?** The enhanced system will:
1. **Constitution-Aware Scoring**: Weight items by constitution articles (workflow chain, context preservation) and add dependency bonuses
2. **Cross-Role Dependency Detection**: Detect dependencies across roles (Planner → Coder → Reviewer) and apply risk-adjusted scoring
3. **Real-time Updates**: Integrate with n8n scrubber for auto-scoring refresh and continuous updates
4. **Async Real-time Scoring**: Implement async real-time scoring updates with bounded concurrency (asyncio.Semaphore) for <5% overhead
5. **Automated Migration**: Migrate backlog items with preserved constitution-linked metadata (dependencies, complexity, risks)
6. **Migration Validation**: Validate migration outputs via ConstitutionCompliance model with 100% metadata preservation

**What are the key features?**
- Constitution-aware scoring formula with dependency bonuses and risk-adjusted scoring
- Cross-role dependency detection (Planner → Coder → Reviewer) with context complexity analysis
- Real-time updates with n8n scrubber integration for auto-scoring refresh
- Async real-time scoring updates with bounded concurrency (asyncio.Semaphore) for <5% overhead
- Automated migration with constitution-linked metadata preservation (dependencies, complexity, risks)
- Migration validation via ConstitutionCompliance model with 100% metadata preservation
- Performance optimization with <5% overhead on real-time scoring updates
- Constitution-aligned scoring integration with existing backlog infrastructure
- Automated backlog organization and item placement
- Intelligent insertion logic based on ID, priority, and dependencies
- Zero new external dependencies for async scoring
