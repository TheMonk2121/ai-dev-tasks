### Common Tasks
- **Add new cache columns**: Modify episodic_logs table schema
- **Update similarity algorithms**: Enhance vector similarity scoring
- **Add cache invalidation**: Implement TTL and cache expiration
- **Update performance monitoring**: Add new cache metrics and dashboards

## 1. Problem Statement

### What's broken?
The current memory system lacks persistent caching of AI generation outputs, missing cache-augmented generation with similarity scoring. This leads to repeated AI model calls, slower response times, and increased API costs. The system cannot intelligently reuse previous generations for similar queries, resulting in inefficient resource utilization and degraded user experience.

### Why does it matter?
Poor caching performance affects user satisfaction through slower response times, increases operational costs through repeated AI model API calls, and limits system scalability. Without intelligent caching, the memory system cannot efficiently serve frequently accessed contexts, leading to performance degradation under increased load and missed opportunities for optimization.

### What's the opportunity?
By implementing a PostgreSQL-based generation cache with similarity scoring, we can achieve 20-30% performance improvement, reduce AI model API costs, and enhance memory system efficiency. This creates a foundation for intelligent cache-augmented generation, enabling faster responses for similar queries and better resource utilization across the entire memory system.

## 2. Solution Overview

### What are we building?
A PostgreSQL-based generation cache system with intelligent similarity scoring, cache hit tracking, and seamless integration with the existing LTST memory system. The system will enable cache-augmented generation support with persistent storage, automatic cache invalidation, and performance monitoring.

### How does it work?
The cache system extends the existing episodic_logs table with cache-specific columns (cache_hit, similarity_score, last_verified), implements vector similarity search for intelligent cache retrieval, and integrates with the LTST memory system for context-aware caching. Cache invalidation uses TTL-based expiration and similarity threshold management.

### What are the key features?
- **PostgreSQL Cache Backend**: Persistent caching with database storage and vector similarity
- **Cache Hit Tracking**: Comprehensive monitoring of cache performance and hit rates
- **Similarity Scoring**: Vector-based similarity algorithms for intelligent cache retrieval
- **Cache Invalidation**: TTL-based expiration and similarity threshold managemen
- **LTST Memory Integration**: Seamless integration with existing memory system
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time cache metrics and optimization insights
