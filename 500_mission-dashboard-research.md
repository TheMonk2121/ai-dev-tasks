## ðŸ”Ž TL;DR
- Surface high-signal KPIs with minimal noise; link traces to tasks
- Stream updates; clear alert banners; drill-down to spans and logs

 
## Key Findings
- Solo/local-first UX benefits from compact KPIs: active tasks, p95 latency, error rate, tokens/task.
- Linking to traces per task dramatically speeds debugging.
- Noise reduction: collapse verbose logs; show only anomalies by default.

 
## Actionable Patterns
- KPI cards + timeline: task count, success/fail, p95 latency, token budget.
- Trace link buttons on each task; expand for spans and logs.
- Alert banners for breached SLOs; click-through to guidance.
