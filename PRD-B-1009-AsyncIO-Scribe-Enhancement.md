## 1. Problem Statement

### What's broken?
The current Scribe system uses synchronous polling architecture with significant performance bottlenecks:
- **File Monitoring**: 10-60 second polling intervals with `time.sleep()` blocking
- **Context Fetching**: Sequential subprocess calls (2-5 seconds each) for Git operations, file reading, and session registry access
- **Session Registry**: Blocking file I/O operations that prevent concurrent session management
- **Multi-Session Management**: Limited to 3 concurrent sessions with manual instance management
- **Real-time Capabilities**: No event-driven notifications or live updates

### Why does it matter?
- **Performance Impact**: 70-80% slower than necessary, especially for multi-session scenarios
- **Resource Waste**: Blocking operations prevent efficient CPU utilization
- **User Experience**: Delayed context capture and slow response times
- **Scalability**: Cannot handle multiple concurrent development sessions efficiently
- **Integration**: Poor integration with real-time DSPy context provision

### What's the opportunity?
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Replace polling with asyncio.watchdog for sub-second response
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent context fetching for 50-80% performance improvement
- **Real-time Notifications**: Live updates for active development sessions
- **Enhanced Multi-Session**: Better management of concurrent development work
- **DSPy Integration**: Seamless async context provision for AI agents

## 2. Solution Overview

### What are we building?
A surgical AsyncIO enhancement to the existing Scribe system that maintains backward compatibility while providing event-driven architecture, parallel processing, and real-time capabilities.

### How does it work?
1. **AsyncScribeDaemon**: Replace polling with asyncio.watchdog for event-driven file monitoring
2. **AsyncScribeContextProvider**: Parallel data fetching using asyncio.gather()
3. **AsyncSessionRegistry**: Non-blocking operations with async file I/O
4. **Real-time Notifications**: WebSocket integration for live session updates
5. **Enhanced Multi-Session**: Concurrent session management with bounded concurrency

### What are the key features?
- **Event-Driven File Monitoring**: Sub-second response to file changes using asyncio.watchdog
- **Parallel Context Fetching**: Concurrent execution of Git operations, file reading, and registry access
- **Async Session Registry**: Non-blocking operations with atomic updates and caching
- **Real-time Notifications**: Live updates for active sessions and context changes
- **Enhanced Multi-Session Management**: Concurrent session handling with resource limits
- **Background Processing**: Async worklog summarization and context analysis
- **DSPy Integration**: Non-blocking context provision for AI agents

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

### How do we know it's done?
- **Performance Targets**: 70-80% improvement in context fetching and file monitoring
- **Response Times**: File change detection <1s, context fetching <2s, session operations <0.5s
- **Concurrency**: Support for 5+ concurrent sessions with bounded resource usage
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing sync interface maintained with async facade
- **Zero New Dependencies**: Uses built-in asyncio and optional asyncio.watchdog only

### What does success look like?
- **Event-Driven Monitoring**: File changes detected in <1s instead of 10-60s
- **Parallel Processing**: Context fetching 50-80% faster through concurrent execution
- **Real-time Updates**: Live notifications for session status and context changes
- **Enhanced Multi-Session**: Efficient management of multiple concurrent development sessions
- **DSPy Integration**: Seamless async context provision for AI agents

### What are the quality gates?
- **Performance Benchmarks**: All targets met with comprehensive benchmarking
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing sync interface works unchanged
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and comprehensive error recovery
- **Resource Management**: Bounded concurrency prevents resource exhaustion
- **Testing Coverage**: 90%+ test coverage for all async components

## 4. Technical Approach

### What technology?
- **Core**: Built-in asyncio (Python 3.7+) for async/await patterns
- **File Monitoring**: asyncio.watchdog for event-driven file system monitoring
- **Concurrency**: asyncio.Semaphore for bounded concurrency control
- **Background Tasks**: asyncio.Queue for worklog processing and summarization
- **Real-time**: Optional WebSocket integration for live notifications
- **Caching**: Async-compatible caching for session registry and context data

### How does it integrate?
- **Existing Scribe**: Extends current `single_doorway.py` and `scribe_context_provider.py`
- **DSPy Integration**: Non-blocking context provision via async interface
- **Memory Rehydrator**: Parallel context fetching integration
- **Session Registry**: Async operations with atomic updates
- **Quality Gates**: Integration with existing testing and validation systems

### What are the constraints?
- **Backward Compatibility**: Must maintain existing sync interface
- **Resource Limits**: M4 Mac with 128GB RAM constraints
- **Zero New Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies
- **Incremental Migration**: Gradual rollout with feature flags
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful degradation under failure conditions

## 5. Risks and Mitigation

### What could go wrong?
- **Performance Regression**: Async overhead could slow down simple operations
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Unbounded concurrency could exhaust system resources
- **Backward Compatibility**: Breaking changes to existing sync interface
- **Complexity Increase**: Async code complexity could reduce maintainability
- **Error Propagation**: Async errors could be harder to debug and handle

### How do we handle it?
- **Performance Testing**: Comprehensive benchmarking before and after implementation
