## 1. Executive Summary

**Project Overview**: Implement a specialized "coder" role in the memory rehydration system to provide focused coding context and best practices for development tasks.

**Success Metrics**:
- Coder role successfully rehydrates coding-focused documentation
- Integration with existing DSPy CodeAgent module
- Improved development efficiency through targeted context retrieval
- Zero impact on existing planner/implementer/researcher roles

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks implementation
**Stakeholders**: Solo developer, AI development ecosystem

## 2. Problem Statement

**Current State**: The memory rehydration system only supports three roles (planner, implementer, researcher), but lacks a specialized "coder" role that was discussed and planned in the backlog (B-035).

**Pain Points**:
- No dedicated coding context retrieval for development tasks
- Missing integration with existing DSPy CodeAgent module
- Inefficient context retrieval for coding-specific queries
- Lack of focused access to coding best practices and examples

**Opportunity**: Leverage existing DSPy CodeAgent infrastructure and comprehensive coding documentation to create a specialized coder role that provides targeted development context.

**Impact**: Improved development efficiency, better code quality through focused context, and enhanced AI assistance for coding tasks.
