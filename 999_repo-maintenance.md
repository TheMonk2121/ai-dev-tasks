### Quick Human Checklist
| âœ… | Cursor = default model everywhere |
| âœ… | 003 described correctly (execution engine, PRD conditional) |
| âœ… | Duplicate files archived |
| âœ… | PRDâ€‘skip rule identical across docs |
| âœ… | No stale "Yiâ€‘Coder default" claims |

---

### When to run
* After **changing default models**, **adjusting PRD rules**, or **merging large doc refactors**.  
* Once per sprint for hygiene.

### How to run
* **Python Script** (Recommended): `python3 scripts/repo_maintenance.py --apply`
* **Dry Run**: `python3 scripts/repo_maintenance.py --dry-run`
* **Auto Commit**: `python3 scripts/repo_maintenance.py --apply --auto-commit`

### Where to document
* **`100_cursor-memory-context.md`** â†’ add under *Maintenance Rituals*:  
  > "Run `python3 scripts/repo_maintenance.py --apply` after model or doc changes."  
* **README / 400_project-overview.md** â†’ final step in Quickâ€‘Start.  
* Reserve **backlog IDs 900â€‘999** for maintenance scripts.

---

*Tip: leave `dry_run:true` for the first run â€“ you'll get a full diff but no files will change.*  
Switch it to `false` when you're ready to apply and (optionally) autoâ€‘commit.

## What this script does not do (by design)
No default_executor metaâ€‘tag. 003 runs every time; it just decides to skip PRD work when the threshold rule says so.

No diagram regeneration mandate. If you prefer ASCII diagrams, keep them; the task only updates wording.

No automatic archive. You confirm the duplicateâ€‘file move so nothing important disappears by accident.

After you run it
Review the diff Cursor shows (or look at staged changes if you set auto_commit:false).

Commit with a message like chore: cursorâ€‘first doc alignment.

Delete or archive 999_repoâ€‘maintenance.md until the next architectural tweak.

That's itâ€”your documentation, workflow description, and file tree will all march in step with the Cursorâ€‘native, PRDâ€‘conditional reality you and Cursor both want.
