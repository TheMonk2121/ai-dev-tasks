## 1. Problem Statement

### What's broken?
The current LTST Memory System requires manual model specification for each request, lacking intelligent routing based on role, task type, and memory context. Users must explicitly choose between models (Cursor Native AI, Yi-Coder, Mistral) for every interaction, leading to suboptimal model selection and reduced efficiency.

### Why does it matter?
- **Reduced Efficiency**: Manual model selection slows down development workflow
- **Suboptimal Performance**: Users may not choose the best model for their specific task
- **Cognitive Overhead**: Developers must remember which model works best for each task type
- **Inconsistent Results**: Different users may choose different models for similar tasks

### What's the opportunity?
Implement intelligent model selection that automatically routes to the most appropriate model based on role, task type, and LTST memory context, improving efficiency and model utilization while maintaining our local-first architecture.

## 2. Solution Overview

### What are we building?
An intelligent model selection system that integrates with the existing LTST Memory System to automatically choose the most appropriate model based on context, role, and task requirements.

### How does it work?
1. **Database-Backed Model Registry**: Store model capabilities and preferences in PostgreSQL
2. **Enhanced CursorModelRouter**: Integrate with existing router using LTST memory context
3. **Context-Aware Routing**: Automatic selection based on role, task type, and memory context
4. **Simple Scoring Algorithm**: Deterministic rules with clear fallback patterns

### What are the key features?
- **Automatic Model Selection**: No manual specification required
- **Role-Based Routing**: Different models for planner, coder, implementer, researcher roles
- **Task-Type Awareness**: Code implementation vs planning vs research vs light cha
- **LTST Memory Integration**: Uses historical context for better decisions
- **Local-First Architecture**: All models remain local and offline
- **Simple Fallbacks**: Clear, predictable fallback patterns

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

### How do we know it's done?
- **Automatic Selection**: System selects appropriate model without manual specification
- **Role-Based Routing**: Planner tasks route to Mistral/Cursor Native AI, coding tasks route to Yi-Coder
- **Context Integration**: LTST memory context influences model selection decisions
- **Fallback Handling**: System gracefully falls back to Cursor Native AI when preferred model unavailable
- **Performance**: Model selection completes in <100ms

### What does success look like?
- **Efficiency Gain**: 50% reduction in manual model selection overhead
- **Accuracy**: 90% of automatic selections match expert manual choices
- **User Satisfaction**: No complaints about model selection quality
- **System Reliability**: 99% uptime for model selection service

### What are the quality gates?
- **Database Schema**: Model registry table created and populated
- **Router Integration**: CursorModelRouter enhanced with LTST integration
- **Testing Coverage**: 80% test coverage for model selection logic
- **Performance**: Selection latency <100ms
- **Fallback Testing**: All fallback scenarios tested and working

## 4. Technical Approach

### What technology?
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with new `model_registry` table
- **Router**: Enhanced `src/dspy_modules/cursor_model_router.py`
- **Memory**: Integration with existing LTST Memory System
- **Logging**: Existing structured tracer for selection decisions

### How does it integrate?
- **LTST Memory System**: Uses memory context for selection decisions
- **CursorModelRouter**: Enhances existing router with intelligent selection
- **Database Schema**: Adds to existing PostgreSQL schema
- **Structured Tracing**: Uses existing logging infrastructure

### What are the constraints?
- **Local-First**: All models must remain local and offline
- **Simplicity**: Avoid complex scoring algorithms (follow 70/30 rule)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code must continue to work
- **Performance**: Must not impact existing system performance

## 5. Risks and Mitigation

### What could go wrong?
- **Model Selection Errors**: Wrong model chosen for task type
- **Performance Degradation**: Model selection adds latency
- **Complexity Creep**: System becomes too complex to maintain
- **Fallback Failures**: System doesn'tt gracefully handle model unavailability

### How do we handle it?
- **Simple Rules**: Use deterministic rules instead of complex algorithms
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track selection latency and optimize
- **Extensive Testing**: Test all selection scenarios and fallbacks
- **Clear Fallbacks**: Always fall back to Cursor Native AI

### What are the unknowns?
- **Optimal Model Mapping**: Which models work best for which task types
- **Performance Impact**: How much latency model selection adds
- **User Preferences**: How users want to override automatic selection

## 6. Testing Strategy

### What needs testing?
- **Model Selection Logic**: All role/task type combinations
- **Fallback Scenarios**: Model unavailability, RAM pressure, context overflow
- **Performance**: Selection latency under various conditions
- **Integration**: LTST memory integration and database operations

### How do we test it?
- **Unit Tests**: Test selection logic in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test with real LTST memory system
- **Performance Tests**: Measure selection latency
- **Fallback Tests**: Simulate model unavailability scenarios

### What's the coverage target?
- **Code Coverage**: 80% minimum for model selection logic
- **Scenario Coverage**: 100% of role/task type combinations
- **Fallback Coverage**: 100% of fallback scenarios

## 7. Implementation Plan

### What are the phases?
