    I'm debugging an async health check issue in our MCP Orchestration Gateway. Here's what's happening:

    **Current Status:**
    - Orchestration gateway starts successfully on port 3002
    - 2 MCP servers are added (ports 3000, 3001)
    - Health check loop starts and runs (we see the logs)
    - But servers remain in "offline" status

    **What We Know:**
    - MCP servers are responding to health checks:
      - Server 1 (port 3000): returns "degraded" status
      - Server 2 (port 3001): returns "healthy" status
    - Health check logic accepts both "healthy" and "degraded" as success
    - Async health check loop is running (we see "Running health checks for 2 servers")
    - But server status never updates from "offline" to "healthy"/"degraded"

    **Key Files:**
    - scripts/mcp_orchestrator.py: Contains HealthChecker and MCPOrchestrator classes
    - scripts/mcp_orchestration_gateway.py: Main gateway server
    - The health check method: check_server_health() in HealthChecker class

    **Questions for Coder:**
    1. What could be causing the server status to not update despite successful health checks?
    2. Are there any async task scheduling issues in the health check loop?
    3. Could there be a race condition or timing issue?
    4. What debugging steps would you recommend?
    5. Should we modify the health check logic or the server status update mechanism?

    Please analyze the code and provide specific debugging recommendations.
