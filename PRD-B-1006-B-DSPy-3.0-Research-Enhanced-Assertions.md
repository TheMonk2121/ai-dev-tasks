## 1. Problem Statement

**What's broken?** The current system has completed DSPy 3.0 core parity migration (B-1006-A) but lacks the enhanced assertion framework capabilities identified in recent research. While basic assertion functionality exists, the system is missing:

- **Research-validated error analysis**: No systematic framework for identifying and categorizing assertion failures
- **Model-specific optimization**: Assertions don't leverage model-specific capabilities and limitations
- **Automated evaluation**: Manual assessment of assertion effectiveness and reliability
- **Performance insights**: No integration of research findings on assertion performance patterns
- **Community best practices**: Missing implementation of proven assertion strategies from industry research

**Impact:** Without these enhancements, the assertion framework remains basic and doesn't leverage the full potential of DSPy 3.0 capabilities or research insights, limiting system reliability and performance optimization opportunities.

## 4. Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Core Assertion Migration
**Objective:** Implement basic DSPy 3.0 native assertions with research-informed enhancements

**Implementation:**
```python
# Enhanced assertion with retry logic
dspy.Assert(
    "response contains required fields",
    lambda x: all(field in x for field in ["title", "summary", "tags"]),
    max_retries=3,
    backoff_factor=2.0
)

# Suggest assertion for non-critical validation
dspy.Suggest(
    "response follows style guidelines",
    lambda x: len(x.get("summary", "")) > 50,
    log_failures=True
)
```

**Research Integration:**
- Apply DSPy 3.0 research findings on retry mechanisms
- Implement exponential backoff with jitter based on research recommendations
- Use model-specific assertion strategies from LiveMCPBench analysis

### Phase 2: Seven-Point Error Analysis Framework
**Objective:** Integrate LiveMCPBench's systematic error categorization

**Error Categories:**
1. **Query Error**: Generated query lacks semantic relevance or granularity mismatch
2. **Retrieve Error**: Semantically appropriate queries fail to match available tools
3. **Tool Error**: Correct tool retrieved but invoked incorrectly
4. **Other Error**: Sporadic failures beyond above categories
5. **Assertion Error**: Native assertion failures with specific patterns
6. **Model Error**: Model-specific limitations or capabilities
7. **System Error**: Infrastructure or framework-level issues

**Implementation:**
```python
class ErrorAnalysisFramework:
    def categorize_error(self, error: Exception, context: dict) -> ErrorCategory:
        # Apply LiveMCPBench categorization logic
        pass

    def generate_insights(self, error_history: List[ErrorCategory]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Provide research-based optimization recommendations
        pass
```

### Phase 3: Model-Specific Optimization
**Objective:** Implement research-based model-specific assertion strategies

**Research Findings Integration:**
- **Claude Models**: Higher success rates (78.95% for Claude-Sonnet-4) â†’ Optimize for complex assertions
- **GPT Models**: Moderate performance â†’ Focus on structured, clear assertions
- **Open Source Models**: Lower performance â†’ Implement fallback strategies

**Implementation:**
```python
class ModelSpecificAssertions:
    def __init__(self, model_name: str):
        self.model_capabilities = self.load_model_profile(model_name)

    def optimize_assertion(self, assertion: dspy.Assert) -> dspy.Assert:
        # Apply model-specific optimizations based on research
        return self.apply_model_strategy(assertion)
```

### Phase 4: LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation
**Objective:** Implement automated assessment methodology

**Implementation:**
```python
class AssertionEvaluator:
    def evaluate_effectiveness(self, assertion_results: List[AssertionResult]) -> float:
        # Apply LLM-as-a-Judge methodology from LiveMCPBench
        return self.llm_judge_evaluation(assertion_results)

    def generate_recommendations(self, evaluation: float) -> List[str]:
        # Provide research-based improvement suggestions
        pass
```
