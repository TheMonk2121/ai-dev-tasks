## Key Insights for AI Memory Systems

### Memory Hierarchy Depth vs. Capacity
- **Finding**: Human memory uses hierarchical organization with multiple levels of abstraction (Gallistel & King, 2009), and working memory has capacity limits of 7±2 items (Miller, 1956)
- **AI Application**: AI memory systems should implement hierarchical organization with different levels of detail, respecting cognitive load limits
- **Implementation Strategy**: Three-tier hierarchy (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) with chunking strategies that respect 7±2 item limits

### Chunking Strategies
- **Finding**: Chunking is fundamental for organizing information into meaningful units (Gobet et al., 2001), with chunk size and organization affecting learning and retrieval efficiency
- **AI Application**: AI memory systems should use optimal chunking strategies that balance information density with retrieval accuracy
- **Implementation Strategy**: YAML front-matter for explicit metadata, with chunk sizes optimized for different model capabilities (7B vs 70B vs 128k context)

### Metadata Organization
- **Finding**: Metacognitive processes and metadata play crucial roles in memory organization and retrieval (Nelson & Narens, 1990), with multiple memory systems having different organizational principles (Tulving, 1972)
- **AI Application**: AI memory systems should use explicit metadata to organize information and support multiple memory subsystems
- **Implementation Strategy**: YAML front-matter with explicit metadata fields (priority, role pins, context references) and dual-encoding with HTML comments as fallback

### Context Preservation
- **Finding**: Memory retrieval is significantly influenced by context, with better recall when encoding and retrieval contexts match (Godden & Baddeley, 1975)
- **AI Application**: AI memory systems should preserve contextual information to improve retrieval accuracy
- **Implementation Strategy**: Context-aware memory organization with sliding-window summarizers for overflow handling and context preservation across different memory levels

### Adaptive Organization
- **Finding**: Memory systems adaptively organize information based on usage patterns (Anderson, 1990, 1991), with frequently accessed information becoming more easily retrievable
- **AI Application**: AI memory systems should adapt organization based on usage patterns and model capabilities
- **Implementation Strategy**: Adaptive memory organization that responds to usage patterns, with model-specific adaptations for different context windows (8k, 32k, 128k)
