## ðŸ”Ž TL;DR

| what this file is | read when | do next |
|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Status**-**Status**: âœ… **ACTIVE**- Research index maintained and current

- **Priority**: ðŸ”¥ High - Critical for research discovery

- **Points**: 3 - Research organization and discovery

- **Dependencies**: 400_guides/400_context-priority-guide.md, 400_guides/400_deployment-environment-guide.md, 400_few-shot-context-examples.md, 400_migration-upgrade-guide.md

- **Next Steps**: Maintain research index and cross-references

### Research Access (shortcuts)

- Complete sources: `docs/research/papers/documentation-context-management-papers.md`

- Pattern research: `500_documentation-coherence-research.md`

- Safety research: `500_maintenance-safety-research.md`

<!-- ANCHOR: key-findings -->
{#key-findings}

## Key Findings (Index-level)

- Align research by topic (mirrors 400_ guides) for tighter retrieval

- Keep raw sources in `docs/research/`; 500_ holds curated syntheses

<!-- ANCHOR: actionable-patterns -->
{#actionable-patterns}

## Actionable Patterns (How to use)

- For any 400_guide section, jump to the paired 500_ fileâ€™s `actionable-patterns`

- Each pattern should include success criteria and quality gates

<!-- ANCHOR: implementation-refs -->
{#implementation-refs}

## Implementation References

- Cross-link to code when applicable (e.g., `dspy-rag-system/src/...`)

<!-- ANCHOR: citations -->
{#citations}

## Citations

- Cite span-level references from `docs/research/` (papers, articles, tutorials)
