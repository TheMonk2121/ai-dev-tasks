3. **How do we ensure coherence when documents are updated?**
4. **What are the relationships between files and how are they maintained?**
5. **How does the system rehydrate Cursor AI with crucial information?**

### **Secondary Questions**

1. **How do we handle conflicts or inconsistencies between documents?**
2. **What is the relationship between the backlog and other documentation?**
3. **How do we ensure the AI gets the right context for different types of tasks?**
4. **What are the failure modes of the current system?**
5. **How can we improve coherence and reduce maintenance overhead?**

### **File Hierarchy & Naming Conventions**

#### **Priority-Based File Organization**

Our system uses a three-digit prefix naming convention to establish hierarchy:

**HIGH Priority (Read First):**

- `400_guides/400_system-overview.md` - Technical architecture
- `000_core/000_backlog.md` - Current priorities and roadmap
- `400_guides/400_project-overview.md` - Project overview and workflow

**MEDIUM Priority (Read as Needed):**

**LOW Priority (Read for Specific Tasks):**

- (archived) Local code model integration guide - see `600_archives/legacy-integrations/`
- `100_memory/100_backlog-guide.md` - Backlog management

#### **Cross-Reference System**

Files use structured comment patterns to establish relationships:

```markdown
<!-- ESSENTIAL_FILES: 400_guides/400_project-overview.md, 400_guides/400_system-overview.md, 000_core/000_backlog.md -->
<!-- IMPLEMENTATION_FILES: 100_memory/104_dspy-development-context.md, 200_setup/202_setup-requirements.md -->
