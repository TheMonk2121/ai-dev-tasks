{"user_input": "what is run-pinning", "system_output": "Run-pinning is when evals unintentionally bind to a specific ingest/run variant via env like INGEST_RUN_ID or CHUNK_VARIANT, causing the harness to reuse pinned artifacts/configs. This can skew results and harm reproducibility. Avoid by unsetting those vars (env -u INGEST_RUN_ID -u CHUNK_VARIANT ...) unless you intentionally want a fixed run. If you need intentional pinning, use EVAL_EXPECT_RUN_ID instead.", "project_dir": "/Users/danieljacobs/Code/ai-dev-tasks", "file_operations": "Appended definition to chat history.", "llm_name": "cursor-ai"}
{"user_input": "which would be best for the long term stability of our repo", "system_output": "Default to strict, unpinned evals (unset INGEST_RUN_ID/CHUNK_VARIANT; UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=.venv).

{"user_input": "what command is going to be easiset for me to understand and for you to execute?", "system_output": "Use the Cursor command: run-gold-eval-smoke. It’s a fast, unpinned sanity check through the harness and is the clearest default.
