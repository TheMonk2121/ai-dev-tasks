# Legacy Project Deliverables

**Archive Date**: 2024-08-07  
**Reason**: Legacy project-specific deliverables with outdated references to deleted split modules

## üìã Overview

These files are project-specific deliverables from completed backlog items (B-011, B-049, B-072) that contain references to split modules that were deleted during the B-073 Giant Guide File Splitting consolidation. The files are preserved for historical reference but are no longer relevant to the current system state.

## üìÅ Files Archived

### **B-011: Cursor Native AI + Specialized Agents Integration**
- `B-011-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive deployment documentation
- `B-011-DEVELOPER-DOCUMENTATION.md` - Developer documentation and architecture
- `B-011-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md` - Implementation summary and status
- `B-011-PRD.md` - Product Requirements Document
- `B-011-Tasks.md` - Detailed task breakdown and implementation plan
- `B-011-USER-DOCUMENTATION.md` - User documentation and guides

### **B-049: Convert 003 Process Task List to Python Script**
- `B-049-PRD.md` - Product Requirements Document
- `B-049-Tasks.md` - Detailed task breakdown and implementation plan

### **B-072: Migration & Upgrade Procedures Guide**
- `B-072-PRD.md` - Product Requirements Document
- `B-072-Tasks.md` - Detailed task breakdown and implementation plan

## üîÑ Why These Files Were Archived

1. **Outdated References**: All files contain references to split modules that were deleted during B-073 consolidation
2. **Project-Specific**: These are deliverables from specific backlog items, not general documentation
3. **Legacy Content**: Information is no longer relevant to current system state
4. **Repository Cleanup**: Moving to archives reduces clutter in main directory
5. **Historical Preservation**: Important to keep for reference and context

## üìä Current Status

- **B-011**: Marked as completed in `000_backlog.md`
- **B-049**: Marked as completed in `000_backlog.md`

## üéØ Archive Organization

This archive follows the established pattern:
- **Location**: `600_archives/legacy-project-deliverables/`
- **Purpose**: Store legacy project-specific deliverables
- **Preservation**: Maintain historical context and reference
- **Organization**: Grouped by project (B-011, B-049, B-072)

## üîÑ Future Considerations

- **Reference Access**: These files can be accessed for historical context
- **Pattern Analysis**: Useful for understanding project evolution
- **Template Reference**: May provide useful templates for future projects
- **Architecture Reference**: Historical implementation patterns
