#### **Context Engineering with DSPy:**
```python
# Example: Context engineering with DSPy signatures
from dspy_modules.model_switcher import ModelSwitcher
from dspy_modules.role_refinement import RoleRefinementModule

# Context engineering for different task types
def engineer_context_for_task(task_type: str, complexity: str):
    switcher = ModelSwitcher()

    # Use ModelSelectionSignature for context optimization
    selection = switcher.select_model(
        task="Context engineering task",
        task_type=task_type,
        complexity=complexity,
        context_size=8192
    )

    return {
        "selected_model": selection.selected_model,
        "reasoning": selection.reasoning,
        "expected_performance": selection.expected_performance
    }
```

## üéØ Task-Type Patterns

### **1. Reasoning Tasks**

**When to Use**: Analysis, explanation, decision-making, problem-solving

**Pattern**:
```text
Let's approach this systematically:

1. First, let me understand the context: [summarize key information]
2. Then, I'll analyze the problem: [break down the issue]
3. Finally, I'll provide a reasoned conclusion: [solution/recommendation]

[Your specific question or task]
```

**Example**:
```text
Let's approach this systematically:

1. First, let me understand the context: We're building a REST API for user management
2. Then, I'll analyze the problem: Need to implement authentication with rate limiting
3. Finally, I'll provide a reasoned conclusion: Best approach for our requirements

What's the most effective way to implement JWT authentication with rate limiting for our user API?
```

### **2. Coding Tasks**

**When to Use**: Implementation, refactoring, debugging, code review

**Pattern**:
```text
I need to [specific coding task].

Context:
- [relevant code/files/constraints]
- [requirements/constraints]
- [existing patterns to follow]

Please provide:
- [specific deliverable]
- [any tests or validation needed]
- [assumptions you're making]
```

**Example**:
```text
I need to implement a user authentication middleware.

Context:
- Using Express.js with JWT
- Need to handle rate limiting
- Should follow existing error handling patterns

Please provide:
- The middleware function
- Basic tests to validate it works
- Any security considerations I should be aware of
```

### **3. Analysis Tasks**

**When to Use**: Code review, performance analysis, architecture evaluation

**Pattern**:
```text
Please analyze [what to analyze] with focus on:

1. [specific aspect 1]
2. [specific aspect 2]
3. [specific aspect 3]

Provide:
- Key findings
- Potential issues
- Recommendations
```

**Example**:
```text
Please analyze this authentication implementation with focus on:

1. Security vulnerabilities
2. Performance implications
3. Maintainability concerns

Provide:
- Key findings
- Potential issues
- Recommendations for improvement
```

### **4. Planning Tasks**

**When to Use**: Architecture design, feature planning, system design

**Pattern**:
```text
I'm planning [what you're planning].

Requirements:
- [requirement 1]
- [requirement 2]
- [requirement 3]

Constraints:
- [constraint 1]
- [constraint 2]

Please help me:
- [specific planning need]
- [any alternatives to consider]
```

**Example**:
```text
I'm planning a user management system.

Requirements:
- User registration and authentication
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging

Constraints:
- Must work with existing database schema
- Should be scalable to 10k+ users

Please help me:
- Design the overall architecture
- Identify potential bottlenecks
- Suggest implementation phases
```

## üîß Context Engineering Strategies

### **1. Progressive Disclosure**

**Principle**: Reveal context in layers, starting with the most important information.

**Strategy**:

1. **Core Question**: Start with the main question or task
2. **Essential Context**: Add only the context needed to understand the question
3. **Supporting Details**: Include additional details that might be helpful
4. **Constraints/Preferences**: Specify any limitations or preferences

**Example**:
```text
‚ùå Poor: [Long explanation of everything before getting to the point]

‚úÖ Better:
I need to implement user authentication. [Core question]
We're using Express.js with JWT tokens. [Essential context]
The API needs to handle 1000+ concurrent users. [Supporting detail]
Must be compatible with our existing error handling middleware. [Constraint]
```

### **2. Clear Boundaries**

**Principle**: Define what the AI should focus on and what it can assume.

**Strategy**:

- **Focus Areas**: Explicitly state what you want the AI to address
- **Assumptions**: List what the AI can assume or doesn't need to worry about
- **Scope**: Define the boundaries of the task

**Example**:
```text
Focus on: The authentication logic and security considerations
Assume: Database connection and basic Express setup are already configured
Scope: Just the middleware function, not the full application setup
```

### **3. Effective Framing**

**Principle**: Frame the problem in a way that guides the AI toward good solutions.

**Strategy**:

- **Problem Statement**: Clearly state what you're trying to solve
- **Success Criteria**: Define what a good solution looks like
- **Context**: Provide relevant background that influences the approach

**Example**:
```text
Problem: Users are experiencing slow login times during peak hours
Success Criteria: Login response time under 200ms, secure authentication
Context: We're using JWT tokens, have 1000+ concurrent users, and need to maintain security
```

### **4. Structured Prompts**

**Principle**: Use consistent structure to make prompts easier to understand and process.

**Strategy**:
```text
TASK: [What you want done]
CONTEXT: [Relevant background information]
CONSTRAINTS: [Limitations or requirements]
EXPECTED OUTPUT: [What format/level of detail you want]
```

## üìä Context Engineering Patterns

### **1. The Funnel Pattern**

Start broad, then narrow down to specifics:

```text
1. High-level overview of the problem
2. Specific requirements and constraints
3. Detailed question or task
4. Expected output format
```

### **2. The Sandwich Pattern**

Context ‚Üí Question ‚Üí Context:

```text
1. Initial context to set the scene
2. Specific question or task
3. Additional context that might influence the answer
```

### **3. The Checklist Pattern**

Break complex tasks into clear steps:

```text
Please help me with [task] by:

1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

For each step, provide:
- [specific deliverable]
- [any considerations]
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### **1. Be Specific**

- **Avoid**: Vague requests like "help me with authentication"
- **Use**: Specific requests like "implement JWT middleware with rate limiting"

### **2. Provide Context**

- **Avoid**: Asking questions without background
- **Use**: Include relevant code, requirements, and constraints

### **3. Set Expectations**

- **Avoid**: Unclear output expectations
- **Use**: Specify format, level of detail, and any specific requirements

### **4. Use Progressive Disclosure**

- **Avoid**: Dumping all information at once
- **Use**: Reveal context in logical layers

### **5. Define Boundaries**

- **Avoid**: Unclear scope
- **Use**: Explicitly state what's in and out of scope

## üîÑ Integration with Workflows

### **PRD Creation (000_core/001_create-prd.md)**
