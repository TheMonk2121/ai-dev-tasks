## Deprecated Files:
- stable_bedrock.env â†’ 600_archives/600_deprecated/configs/stable_bedrock.env.deprecated

## Current Configuration:
The canonical evaluation system now uses:
- scripts/configs/profiles/gold.env (primary)
- scripts/configs/profiles/real.env (alternative)
- scripts/configs/profiles/mock.env (testing only)

## Migration:
All evaluation scripts have been updated to use the gold profile configuration by default.
The gold profile includes complete RAG system settings, fusion parameters, and database configuration.
