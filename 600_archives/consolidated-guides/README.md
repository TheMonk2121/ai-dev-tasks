# Consolidated Guides Archive

## Overview

This directory contains guides that were consolidated during the guide restructuring project (Phases 1-4). These guides have been merged into new, role-agnostic, task-based guides for better maintainability and user experience.

## Consolidation Benefits

### **Before Consolidation**
- **20+ scattered guides** with overlapping content
- **Role-dependent structure** that required restructuring when roles evolved
- **Inconsistent navigation** and cross-references
- **High maintenance overhead** for keeping guides synchronized

### **After Consolidation**
- **6 core guides** covering all major development activities
- **Role-agnostic structure** that's stable and maintainable
- **Task-based navigation** that's intuitive and consistent
- **Reduced complexity** and maintenance overhead

## New Guide Structure

The consolidated guides are now organized as:

1. **`400_getting-started.md`** - Entry point and project overview
2. **`400_guide-index.md`** - Navigation hub for all guides
3. **`400_development-workflow.md`** - Complete development workflow
4. **`400_deployment-operations.md`** - Deployment and operations
5. **`400_integration-security.md`** - Integration and security
6. **`400_quick-reference.md`** - Quick commands and shortcuts

## Migration Notes

### **Content Preservation**
All content from the archived guides has been preserved and reorganized into the new consolidated guides. The new structure provides:

- **Better organization**: Content is organized by workflow stages rather than abstract concepts
- **Improved navigation**: Task-based navigation makes it easier to find relevant information
- **Consistent cross-references**: All guides use consistent naming and cross-reference patterns

### **Command Updates**
All commands in the consolidated guides have been updated to use:

- **`./scripts/memory_up.sh`** for memory rehydration
- **`python3 scripts/single_doorway.py`** for workflow orchestration
- **Actual working scripts** rather than placeholder commands

### **Cross-Reference Updates**
All cross-references have been updated to point to the new consolidated guides:

- **Old**: `400_testing-strategy-guide.md` → **New**: `400_development-workflow.md`
- **Old**: `400_project-overview.md` → **New**: `400_getting-started.md`
- **Old**: `400_deployment-environment-guide.md` → **New**: `400_deployment-operations.md`
- **Old**: `400_integration-patterns-guide.md` → **New**: `400_integration-security.md`

## Archive Date

**Archived**: August 25, 2025
**Consolidation Project**: Phases 1-4 Guide Restructuring
**Total Size**: ~250KB of consolidated content

## Recovery Information

If you need to access the original content:

1. **Check the new consolidated guides first** - they contain all the original content in a better organized format
2. **Use the guide index** - `400_guides/400_guide-index.md` provides task-based navigation
3. **Search the new guides** - the consolidated guides include comprehensive searchable content

The archived files are preserved for reference but should not be used for new development work.
