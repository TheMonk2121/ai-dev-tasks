# Deprecated Completion Summaries

**Archive Date**: 2024-08-07  
**Reason**: Legacy files with outdated references to deleted split modules

## üìã Overview

These completion summary files were moved to archives because they contain references to split modules that were deleted during the B-073 Giant Guide File Splitting consolidation. The files are preserved for historical reference but are no longer relevant to the current system state.
