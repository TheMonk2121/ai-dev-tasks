DSPy Role Discussion: Memory Systems & Over-Engineering

    We need your expertise on our memory systems and complexity concerns.

    CONTEXT:
    - We have sophisticated LTST memory system with 5-layer architecture and hybrid retrieval
    - MCP memory server with distributed orchestration and health checks
    - Complex memory rehydration with role-based filtering
    - Performance monitoring gaps (no query performance tracking)

    CONCERNS:
    - We may be over-engineering for a solo developer
    - Complex systems when simpler solutions might work
    - Performance monitoring gaps
    - Want to maintain memory quality while reducing complexity

    QUESTIONS:
    1. What aspects of our memory systems are justified sophistication vs over-engineering?
    2. How can we strengthen our existing memory systems without adding complexity?
    3. What performance monitoring gaps should we address first?
    4. What would you recommend for balancing sophistication with simplicity?
    5. Are there specific components we should simplify or remove?

    Please provide your analysis and recommendations based on your role's expertise.
