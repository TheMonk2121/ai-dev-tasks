Sample Notes for RAG System

This is a sample document to demonstrate how to add documents to your DSPy RAG system.

Key Points:
1. You can add any text-based document
2. The system will automatically chunk and embed it
3. You can then query it with natural language
4. Multiple documents create a comprehensive knowledge base

Technical Details:
- Documents are processed into 500-character chunks
- Each chunk gets a 384-dimensional embedding
- Similarity search finds the most relevant chunks
- PostgreSQL with pgvector stores everything

Benefits:
- Local-first design
- No cloud dependencies
- Fast semantic search
- Easy to scale with more documents
