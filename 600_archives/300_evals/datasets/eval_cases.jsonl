{"query_id": "case_1", "query": "What is DSPy and how does it work?", "gt_answer": "DSPy is a framework for programming with foundation models that provides a systematic approach to building and optimizing AI systems. It works by treating language model calls as learnable modules that can be composed, optimized, and fine-tuned."}
{"query_id": "case_2", "query": "How do I implement a RAG system with DSPy?", "gt_answer": "To implement a RAG system with DSPy, you typically create a RAGModule that combines retrieval and generation components. The system retrieves relevant documents from a vector store and uses them as context for generating answers."}
{"query_id": "case_3", "query": "What are the key components of the memory system?", "gt_answer": "The key components of the memory system include the LTST Memory System (database), Cursor Memory System, Go CLI Memory System, and Prime Memory System. These work together to maintain context across AI sessions."}
{"query_id": "case_4", "query": "How does the evaluation system work?", "gt_answer": "The evaluation system uses RAGChecker to assess RAG performance with metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score. It can evaluate both synthetic test cases and real RAG system responses."}
{"query_id": "case_5", "query": "What is the purpose of the fusion adapter?", "gt_answer": "The fusion adapter combines multiple retrieval channels (BM25, vector search) using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) and cross-encoder reranking to improve retrieval quality and recall."}
