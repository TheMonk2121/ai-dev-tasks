# Product Requirements Document: Automated Role Assignment for 600_archives

## 1. Executive Summary

**Project**: Automated Role Assignment for 600_archives
**Success Metrics**: 600_archives files automatically get appropriate role access based on metadata or content analysis
**Timeline**: 4 hours implementation
**Stakeholders**: Solo developer, AI development ecosystem

## 2. Problem Statement

**Current State**: Files in 600_archives require manual role assignment in the memory rehydrator, creating maintenance burden and potential for oversight.

**Pain Points**:
- Manual maintenance required for every new archived file
- No systematic way to determine which roles need access
- Easy to forget to update the memory rehydrator
- No granular control over role access to archived content
- All-or-nothing access to 600_archives directory

**Opportunity**: Implement automated role assignment system that reduces manual maintenance and improves scalability.

**Impact**: Reduces maintenance burden, improves system scalability, and ensures appropriate role access to archived content.

## 3. Solution Overview

**High-Level Solution**: Implement metadata-based automated role assignment system for 600_archives files.

**Key Features**:
- Metadata standards for archived files
- Automated role assignment based on content analysis
- Integration with memory rehydrator
- Default role assignments for different file types
- Content-based role suggestion system

**Technical Approach**: Metadata analysis + content analysis + memory rehydrator integration

**Integration Points**:
- 600_archives file metadata
- Memory rehydrator role assignment logic
- Content analysis for role relevance
- Automated suggestion system
