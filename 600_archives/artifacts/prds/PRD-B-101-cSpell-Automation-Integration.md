## 1. Executive Summary

**Project**: cSpell Automation Integration for Coder Role
**Success Metrics**: Automated cSpell word addition with coder role context
**Timeline**: 3 hours implementation
**Stakeholders**: Solo developer, AI development ecosystem

## 2. Problem Statement

**Current State**: User frequently requests adding words to cSpell configuration in VS Code settings.json, requiring manual editing and repetitive tasks.

**Pain Points**:
- Manual editing of settings.json is time-consuming
- No validation of word format or duplicates
- Inconsistent alphabetical ordering
- No integration with existing role system

**Opportunity**: Automate this frequent, deterministic task by integrating it into the coder role system.

**Impact**: Reduces development friction and improves consistency in development tooling configuration.

## 3. Solution Overview

**High-Level Solution**: Create automated cSpell word addition script integrated with coder role for seamless development tooling automation.

**Key Features**:
- Automated word addition to VS Code settings.json
- Alphabetical order maintenance
- Duplicate prevention
- Word format validation
- Integration with coder role context
- Dry-run mode for preview

**Technical Approach**: Python script with JSON manipulation, integrated into memory rehydration system's coder role.

**Integration Points**:
- Coder role in memory rehydrator system
- VS Code settings.json configuration
- Cursor rules for automation detection
- Memory context for pattern documentation

## 4. Functional Requirements

**User Stories**:
- As a developer, I want to add words to cSpell by simply requesting it, so that my development environment is automatically configured
- As a developer, I want the system to maintain alphabetical order, so that the word list remains organized
- As a developer, I want duplicate prevention, so that I don't accidentally add the same word twice
- As a developer, I want word validation, so that only valid words are added to the configuration

**Feature Specifications**:
- Parse user word list from command line or file input
- Validate word format (alphanumeric + underscore/hyphen, minimum 2 characters)
- Check for existing words to prevent duplicates
- Insert new words in alphabetical order
- Preserve JSON structure and formatting
- Provide dry-run mode for preview
- Support both direct input and file-based input

**Data Requirements**:
- VS Code settings.json file structure
- cSpell.words array format
- Word validation rules
- Alphabetical ordering logic

**API Requirements**:
- Command-line interface for script execution
- File input/output for batch processing
- Error handling and status reporting

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance Requirements**:
- Script execution time < 1 second for typical word lists
- Memory usage < 10MB for large word lists
- File I/O operations optimized for settings.json

**Security Requirements**:
- Validate word format to prevent injection attacks
- Preserve existing settings.json structure
- No execution of arbitrary code from word input

**Reliability Requirements**:
- Graceful handling of malformed settings.json
- Automatic backup before modifications
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting

**Usability Requirements**:
- Simple command-line interface
- Clear success/failure feedback
- Helpful error messages
- Integration with existing role system

## 6. Testing Strategy
