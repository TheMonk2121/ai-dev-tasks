# üìù Documentation Example: Memory Scaffolding in Practice

This example demonstrates how to create documentation that contributes meaningfully to the memory context system, following the guidelines in `200_naming-conventions.md`.

<!-- CONTEXT_REFERENCE: CONTEXT_PRIORITY_GUIDE.md -->
<!-- MEMORY_CONTEXT: MEDIUM - Example of proper memory scaffolding documentation -->
<!-- RELATED_FILES: 200_naming-conventions.md, MEMORY_CONTEXT_GUIDE.md -->

## üéØ **Purpose**
This file shows how to document new features in a way that builds meaningful memory scaffolding for both humans and AI assistants.

## üß† **Memory Scaffolding Example**

### **Scenario**: Adding a New Feature - "Advanced Error Recovery"

When documenting this feature, we would follow these memory scaffolding principles:

#### **1. Memory Context Comment (Required)**
```html
<!-- MEMORY_CONTEXT: MEDIUM - Advanced error recovery workflow for AI task execution -->
```

#### **2. Context Header Structure**
```markdown
# üîß Advanced Error Recovery & Prevention

This feature reduces development friction with intelligent error handling and AI-generated HotFix solutions.

<!-- CONTEXT_REFERENCE: CONTEXT_PRIORITY_GUIDE.md -->
<!-- MEMORY_CONTEXT: MEDIUM - Advanced error recovery workflow for AI task execution -->
<!-- WORKFLOW_FILES: 03_process-task-list.md, 104_dspy-development-context.md -->
<!-- BACKLOG_REFERENCE: 00_backlog.md -->
```

#### **3. AI Development Ecosystem Context**
```markdown
### **AI Development Ecosystem Context**
This Advanced Error Recovery feature is part of a comprehensive AI-powered development ecosystem that transforms ideas into working software using AI agents (Mistral 7B Instruct + Yi-Coder-9B-Chat-Q6_K). The ecosystem provides structured workflows, automated task processing, and intelligent error recovery to make AI-assisted development efficient and reliable.

**Key Components:**
- **Planning Layer**: PRD Creation, Task Generation, Process Management
- **AI Execution Layer**: Mistral 7B Instruct (Planning), Yi-Coder-9B-Chat-Q6_K (Implementation)
- **Core Systems**: DSPy RAG System, N8N Workflows, Dashboard, Testing Framework
- **Supporting Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL + PGVector, File Watching, Notification System
```

#### **4. Structured Status Information**
```markdown
## üéØ **Current Status**
- **Status**: üîÑ **IN PROGRESS** - Implementation phase
- **Priority**: üî• Critical - Reduces development friction
- **Points**: 5 - Moderate complexity
- **Dependencies**: Enhanced RAG system
- **Next Steps**: Implement AI analysis + HotFix generation

## ü§î **Decision Record**
**Date**: 2024-08-06
**Decision**: Use AI-generated HotFix approach instead of manual error handling
**Rationale**: Leverages existing AI capabilities and provides faster resolution
**Alternatives Considered**: Manual error handling, rule-based system
**Impact**: Reduces development friction and improves AI task success rate
```

#### **5. Learning Notes**
```markdown
## üìö **Learning Notes**
**Discovery**: AI assistants need structured error context to generate effective fixes
**Implication**: Error recovery system must provide rich context to AI models
**Action Items**: 
- Implement error context extraction
- Create HotFix generation workflow
- Add error pattern learning
```

## üîÑ **Memory Context Integration**
