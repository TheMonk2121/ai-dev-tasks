# _ragchecker_eval_impl.py - DEPRECATED

**Date Deprecated:** 2025-01-27  
**Reason:** File moved to archives as part of codebase cleanup  
**Original Location:** `scripts/evaluation/_ragchecker_eval_impl.py`  
**Current Location:** `600_archives/600_deprecated/_ragchecker_eval_impl.py`

## What This File Did

This was a comprehensive RAGChecker evaluation harness that:

- Implemented evaluation framework for DSPy-based RAG systems
- Provided both real and synthetic evaluation modes
- Calculated precision, recall, F1, and faithfulness metrics
- Supported file oracle tracking and progress logging
- Integrated with DSPy RAG components for actual retrieval and generation

## Deprecation Notes

- File was moved to archives as part of codebase cleanup
- Functionality may have been superseded by newer evaluation frameworks
- File is preserved for historical reference and potential future use
- No immediate replacement identified at time of deprecation

## Usage History

This file was part of the evaluation system for testing RAG performance against gold standard cases, validating retrieval and reader components, and providing baseline metrics for system improvements.

## Restoration

If this file needs to be restored, it can be moved back to `scripts/evaluation/` directory, but consider:
1. Whether newer evaluation frameworks exist
2. If the functionality is still needed
3. Whether the code needs updates for current system architecture
