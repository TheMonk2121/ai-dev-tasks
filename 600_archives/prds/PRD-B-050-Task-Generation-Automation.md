## üîé TL;DR

| what this file is | read when | do next |
|---|---|---|
| PRD for automating the task generation workflow to improve efficiency and quality | When implementing B-050 task automation | 1) Review requirements; 2) Design automation system; 3) Implement and test |

## üéØ Problem Statement

The current task generation workflow in `000_core/002_generate-tasks.md` is manual and time-consuming. Each task requires:
- Manual parsing of PRDs or backlog items
- Manual creation of task templates
- Manual addition of testing requirements
- Manual quality gate setup
- Manual dependency analysis

This creates:
- **Inconsistency** in task quality and format
- **Time overhead** for repetitive manual work
- **Risk of missing** critical testing requirements
- **Difficulty scaling** as project complexity increases

## üéØ Solution Overview

Create an automated task generation system that:
1. **Parses PRDs/backlog items** automatically
2. **Generates consistent task templates** with all required sections
3. **Automatically includes testing requirements** based on task type
4. **Sets up quality gates** with appropriate criteria
5. **Analyzes dependencies** and creates task relationships
6. **Integrates with existing workflow** seamlessly
