### Development Patterns
- **Quality Gate Scripts**: `scripts/` - Academic citation validation and quality enforcemen
- **Core Implementation**: `src/` - Modular citation, gating, and research systems
- **Documentation**: `400_guides/` - Comprehensive usage guides and integration
- **Quality Gates**: Integration with development workflow and CI/CD

### Local Developmen
```bash
# Verify academic citation system
python3 -c "from src.citation.academic_validator import AcademicCitationValidator; print('✅ Academic citation system ready!')"

# Verify quality gate enforcer
python3 -c "from src.gating.quality_gate_enforcer import QualityGateEnforcer; print('✅ Quality gate system ready!')"

# Run citation validation tes
python3 -m pytest tests/test_citation_validation.py -v

# Check quality gate status
python3 scripts/quality_gate_enforcer.py --status
```

### Common Tasks
- **Add new citation validator**: Create in `src/citation/` with academic standards
- **Update quality gates**: Modify gate criteria in quality gate enforcer
- **Enhance research pipeline**: Add new complexity levels or validation methods
- **Update documentation**: Maintain 00-12 guide system integration

## 1. Problem Statement

### What's broken?
No academic-grade quality gates or citation standards in the research-implementation pipeline. Current RAGChecker baseline shows 14.9% precision vs. industry targets of 80%+, and backlog items lack rigorous academic citation requirements. Research-to-implementation lacks quality gates for source validation, and existing documentation lacks structured academic source mapping.

### Why does it matter?
Poor citation quality affects development standards and research rigor. Inconsistent evaluation makes optimization difficult, and no quality gates lead to implementation of inadequately researched features. This impacts the overall quality and credibility of the development process, especially for academic-grade projects.

### What's the opportunity?
Industry-leading academic citation quality standards with automated quality gates. Consistent quality assessment across research-implementation pipeline, automated validation for reliable deployments, and establishment of best practices for academic-grade development that even commercial AI research agents struggle to achieve.

## 2. Solution Overview

### What are we building?
Academic-grade quality gates and citation standards system integrated into the research-implementation pipeline, with RAGChecker validation, three-level complexity framework, and comprehensive academic source validation.

### How does it work?
Academic citation requirements for all backlog items, RAGChecker quality gates for workflow progression, question-first research approach with complexity grading, and comprehensive source quality tracking with peer-review validation.

### What are the key features?
- **Academic Citation Standards**: Peer-reviewed, post-2020 source requirements
- **RAGChecker Quality Gates**: Automated validation before workflow progression
- **Three-Level Complexity Framework**: Sentence → paragraph → detailed grading
- **Source Quality Scoring**: Automated peer-review status and domain relevance
- **Research Pipeline Enhancement**: Question-first approach with reverse prompt engineering
- **Documentation Optimization**: Academic source mapping and quality tracking
