**Solution Strategy**:

#### **A. AST-Based Code Analysis**
```python
import ast

class ASTAnalyzer:
    def analyze_complexity(self, code):
        # Cyclomatic complexity calculation
        # Cognitive complexity measurement
        # Depth of inheritance analysis
        # Number of parameters per function
        # Lines of code per function

    def detect_patterns(self, code):
        # Design pattern identification
        # Code smell detection
        # Anti-pattern recognition
        # Refactoring opportunities
```

#### **B. Static Analysis Integration**

### **3. More Diverse Recommendation Patterns** âš¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Current Issue**: Repetitive recommendations ("Review dependencies and reduce coupling" - 6 instances)

**Solution Strategy**:

#### **A. Recommendation Template System**
```python
RECOMMENDATION_TEMPLATES = {
    "security": {
        "high_priority": [
            "Implement input validation for {component} to prevent {vulnerability_type}",
            "Add authentication checks in {component} for {resource_type}",
            "Use parameterized queries in {component} to prevent SQL injection",
            "Implement rate limiting for {component} to prevent abuse",
            "Add encryption for sensitive data in {component}"
        ],
        "medium_priority": [
            "Review authorization logic in {component}",
            "Add logging for security events in {component}",
            "Implement secure session management in {component}",
            "Add security headers in {component}",
            "Review error handling to prevent information disclosure in {component}"
        ]
    },
    "performance": {
        "high_priority": [
            "Optimize database queries in {component} to reduce {metric} by {percentage}",
            "Implement caching for {component} to improve response time",
            "Add connection pooling in {component} to reduce overhead",
            "Optimize algorithm complexity in {component} from O({current}) to O({target})",
            "Implement lazy loading in {component} to reduce memory usage"
        ]
    }
}
```

#### **B. Context-Aware Suggestion Generator**
```python
class ContextAwareGenerator:
    def generate_suggestions(self, context, category, priority):
        # Analyze context (component type, complexity, dependencies)
        # Select appropriate template category
        # Fill template with context-specific information
        # Generate multiple diverse suggestions
        # Rank by relevance and impact
```

#### **C. Industry Best Practices Database**
```python
class BestPracticesDB:
    def get_practices(self, category, context):
        # Security best practices
        # Performance optimization techniques
        # Testing methodologies
        # Scalability patterns
        # Code quality standards
```

#### **D. Diversity Scoring Algorithm**
```python
class DiversityScorer:
    def calculate_diversity(self, recommendations):
        # Check for repetition
        # Measure variety in suggestion types
        # Assess coverage breadth
        # Calculate innovation level
        # Ensure balanced recommendations
```

**Expected Improvement**: +50% recommendation diversity

**Solution Strategy**:

#### **A. Multi-Factor Quality Assessment**
```python
class QualityAssessor:
    def assess_quality(self, result):
        factors = {
            "technical_depth": {
                "weight": 0.3,
                "score": self.assess_technical_depth(result)
            },
            "category_relevance": {
                "weight": 0.25,
                "score": self.assess_category_relevance(result)
            },
            "recommendation_quality": {
                "weight": 0.25,

            },
            "insight_diversity": {
                "weight": 0.2,
                "score": self.assess_diversity(result)
            }
        }
        return self.calculate_weighted_score(factors)
```

#### **B. Technical Depth Scoring**
```python
class TechnicalDepthScorer:
    def assess_depth(self, result):
        # Code complexity analysis depth
        # Architecture assessment quality
        # Design pattern recognition
        # Technical debt evaluation
        # Performance considerations
        # Return depth score (0-1)
```

#### **C. Category-Specific Metrics**
```python
CATEGORY_METRICS = {
    "security": {
        "vulnerability_detection_rate": 0.3,
        "security_best_practices_coverage": 0.3,
        "risk_assessment_accuracy": 0.2,
        "remediation_guidance_quality": 0.2
    },
    "performance": {
        "bottleneck_identification_rate": 0.3,
        "optimization_opportunity_detection": 0.3,
        "performance_metrics_analysis": 0.2,
        "scalability_assessment": 0.2
    }
}
```

#### **D. Human Feedback Integration**
```python
class FeedbackIntegrator:
    def integrate_feedback(self, result_id, human_score, feedback):
        # Store human feedback
        # Adjust scoring algorithm
        # Learn from feedback patterns
        # Improve accuracy over time
```

**Expected Improvement**: +40% quality scoring accuracy
