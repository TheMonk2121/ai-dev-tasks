# üî¨ Deep Research: Repository Maintenance Safety & Critical File Protection

## üéØ Research Objective
Analyze the root causes of critical file archiving during repository maintenance and design a comprehensive safety system to prevent this issue from occurring again.

## üìã Research Context

### **Recent Incident Analysis**
- **What Happened**: Repository maintenance script archived `CURRENT_STATUS.md` and other critical files
- **Impact**: Documentation references became broken, system status tracking lost
- **Root Cause**: Content-based duplicate detection without reference checking
- **Recovery**: Manual restoration and updates to reflect current architecture

### **Current System State**
- **Maintenance Script**: `scripts/repo_maintenance.py` with content-based duplicate detection
- **Archiving Logic**: Moves files to `docs/legacy/` based on content similarity
- **Reference System**: Documentation files reference specific file paths
- **Safety Measures**: Basic exclude patterns, no reference validation

## üîç Research Questions

### **Primary Questions**
1. **What are the fundamental flaws in the current archiving logic?**
2. **How can we implement comprehensive reference tracking?**
3. **What safety mechanisms are needed for critical files?**
4. **How should we balance cleanup vs. safety in maintenance?**
5. **What monitoring and validation systems are required?**

### **Secondary Questions**
6. **How do other projects handle this problem?**
7. **What are the best practices for automated maintenance?**
8. **How can we implement progressive safety levels?**
9. **What role should human oversight play?**
10. **How do we measure and track maintenance safety?**
