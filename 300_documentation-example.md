```markdown
## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Status**
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS** - Implementation phase
- **Priority**: ðŸ”¥ Critical - Reduces development friction
- **Points**: 5 - Moderate complexity
- **Dependencies**: Enhanced RAG system
- **Next Steps**: Implement AI analysis + HotFix generation

## ðŸ¤” **Decision Record**
**Date**: 2024-08-06
**Decision**: Use AI-generated HotFix approach instead of manual error handling
**Rationale**: Leverages existing AI capabilities and provides faster resolution
**Alternatives Considered**: Manual error handling, rule-based system
**Impact**: Reduces development friction and improves AI task success rate
```

#### **5. Learning Notes**
```markdown
## ðŸ“š **Learning Notes**
**Discovery**: AI assistants need structured error context to generate effective fixes
**Implication**: Error recovery system must provide rich context to AI models
**Action Items**: 
- Implement error context extraction
- Create HotFix generation workflow
- Add error pattern learning
```

## ðŸ”„ **Memory Context Integration**
