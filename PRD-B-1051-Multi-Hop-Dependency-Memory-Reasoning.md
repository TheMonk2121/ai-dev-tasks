### Common Tasks
- **Add new dependency analysis**: Create in `scripts/` with existing dependency infrastructure
- **Update memory pattern analysis**: Modify memory pattern analyzer for enhanced optimization
- **Add quality gates**: Integrate with existing dependency monitoring and memory systems
- **Update documentation**: Maintain 00-12 guide system integration

## 1. Problem Statement

### What's broken?
Current system lacks multi-hop dependency reasoning capabilities, missing ability to trace ripple effects of code changes, understand dependency chains, perform impact analysis, and optimize memory retrieval based on dependency patterns. The existing dependency tracking system provides static dependency data but cannot reason about change impacts or optimize memory based on dependency relationships.

### Why does it matter?
Without multi-hop dependency reasoning, the system cannot answer critical questions like "What will break if I change this function?" or "Why is this test failing?" This limits the coding agent's effectiveness and prevents optimization of memory retrieval based on dependency patterns, reducing the overall efficiency of the AI development ecosystem.

### What's the opportunity?
Implement comprehensive multi-hop dependency reasoning system that combines dependency traversal, impact analysis, memory pattern optimization, and AI-powered reasoning, integrated with existing dependency tracking and memory systems. This will transform the system from static dependency tracking to intelligent dependency reasoning and memory optimization.

## 2. Solution Overview

### What are we building?
A comprehensive multi-hop dependency reasoning system that combines dependency traversal, impact analysis, memory pattern optimization, and AI-powered reasoning, integrated with existing dependency tracking and memory systems.

### How does it work?
Dependency graphs are traversed using multi-hop algorithms to identify impact chains, analyzed for memory retrieval patterns, optimized based on dependency relationships, and enhanced with AI-powered reasoning through DSPy modules. Memory system integration provides context-aware dependency analysis.
