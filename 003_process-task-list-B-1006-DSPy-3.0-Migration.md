## 🚨 **Risk Mitigation**

### Technical Risks
- **Breaking changes in DSPy 3.0 API**: Comprehensive testing in isolated environment
- **Performance regression**: Performance benchmarking at each phase
- **MLflow integration complexity**: Gradual integration with fallback options

### Timeline Risks
- **DSPy 3.0 availability delays**: Buffer time allocation
- **Complex integration issues**: Parallel development tracks where possible

### Resource Risks
- **Limited testing environment resources**: Resource planning and staged deployment
- **Production deployment complexity**: Gradual rollout with monitoring

## 📝 **Execution Notes**

### Safety Rules
- **Database Changes**: Always pause for human review
- **Deployment Scripts**: Always pause for human review
- **Consecutive Failures**: Stop execution after 2 consecutive failures
- **Uncaught Exceptions**: Generate HotFix task and pause

### Recovery Process
1. Generate HotFix task with error details
2. Execute HotFix task
3. Retry original task
4. Continue normal execution

### Human Checkpoints
- Critical priority tasks require human approval
- Production deployment changes require review
- HotFix completions need validation
- User can explicitly request pause at any time
