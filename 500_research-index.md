## ðŸ”Ž TL;DR

| what this file is | read when | do next |
|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Status**

- **Status**: âœ… **ACTIVE** - Research index maintained and current

- **Priority**: ðŸ”¥ High - Critical for research discovery

- **Points**: 3 - Research organization and discovery

- **Dependencies**: 400_context-priority-guide.md, 400_deployment-environment-guide.md, 400_few-shot-context-examples.md, 400_migration-upgrade-guide.md

- **Next Steps**: Maintain research index and cross-references


### Research Access (shortcuts)

- Complete sources: `docs/research/papers/documentation-context-management-papers.md`

- Pattern research: `500_documentation-coherence-research.md`

- Safety research: `500_maintenance-safety-research.md`

<!-- ANCHOR: key-findings -->
<a id="key-findings"></a>

## Key Findings (Index-level)

- Align research by topic (mirrors 400_ guides) for tighter retrieval

- Keep raw sources in `docs/research/`; 500_ holds curated syntheses

<!-- ANCHOR: actionable-patterns -->
<a id="actionable-patterns"></a>

## Actionable Patterns (How to use)

- For any 400_ guide section, jump to the paired 500_ fileâ€™s `actionable-patterns`

- Each pattern should include success criteria and quality gates

<a id="implementation-refs"></a>

## Implementation References

- Cross-link to code when applicable (e.g., `dspy-rag-system/src/...`)

<!-- ANCHOR: citations -->
<a id="citations"></a>

## Citations

- Cite span-level references from `docs/research/` (papers, articles, tutorials)
