## ðŸ”Ž TL;DR

- Central map of 500_ research files aligned to 400_ guides
- Use as the single entry for research retrieval and updates
- Pattern: research â†’ actionable patterns â†’ implementation refs â†’ citations

<!-- ANCHOR: key-findings -->
<a id="key-findings"></a>

## Key Findings (Index-level)

- Align research by topic (mirrors 400_ guides) for tighter retrieval
- Keep raw sources in `docs/research/`; 500_ holds curated syntheses

<!-- ANCHOR: actionable-patterns -->
<a id="actionable-patterns"></a>

## Actionable Patterns (How to use)

- For any 400_ guide section, jump to the paired 500_ fileâ€™s `actionable-patterns`
- Each pattern should include success criteria and quality gates

<!-- ANCHOR: implementation-refs -->
<a id="implementation-refs"></a>

## Implementation References

- Cross-link to code when applicable (e.g., `dspy-rag-system/src/...`)

<!-- ANCHOR: citations -->
<a id="citations"></a>

## Citations

- Cite span-level references from `docs/research/` (papers, articles, tutorials)
