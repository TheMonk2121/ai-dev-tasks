# PRD: 00-12 Guide Restructuring for Enhanced Flow and Maintainability

## **0. Project Context & Implementation Guide**

### **Current Tech Stack**
- **Documentation Framework**: Markdown-based 00-12 guide system with tiered organization
- **Memory System**: Unified Memory Orchestrator with LTST, Cursor, Go CLI, and Prime systems
- **Cross-Reference System**: Anchor-based linking with explicit file paths
- **Validation**: Markdown linting, link checking, and constitution compliance
- **Integration**: DSPy signature validation, CI/CD gates, and automated workflows

### **Repository Layout**
- **000_core/**: Core workflow guides (backlog, PRD, tasks, execution)
- **100_memory/**: Memory context and rehydration systems
- **400_guides/**: Comprehensive documentation (00-12 numbered guides)
- **500_research/**: Research findings and analysis
- **600_archives/**: Legacy and deprecated content
- **scripts/**: Automation and utility scripts

### **Development Patterns**
- **Constitution-First**: Critical policies and safety ops anchors
- **Role-Based Context**: Planner, Implementer, Researcher, Coder perspectives
- **Memory Rehydration**: Automated context retrieval via `./scripts/memory_up.sh`
- **Cross-Reference Integrity**: Single canonical source per topic with explicit links

### **Local Development**
- **Memory Hydration**: `./scripts/memory_up.sh` for context rehydration
- **Validation**: `markdownlint`, `python scripts/quick_conflict_check.py`
- **Testing**: `python scripts/ragus_evaluation.py` for memory system validation
- **Quality Gates**: Pre-commit hooks and CI validation

### **Common Tasks**
- **Context Rehydration**: Run memory orchestrator for role-specific context
- **Guide Updates**: Follow constitution rules and preserve cross-references
- **Validation**: Check links, headings, and constitution compliance
- **Integration**: Update memory context after structural changes

## **1. Problem Statement**

### **What's broken?**
The current 00-12 guide structure has evolved organically and now presents several challenges:

1. **Logical Flow Issues**: Guides are not arranged in a natural reading sequence for both humans and AI
2. **Scanning Inefficiency**: Critical information is scattered across multiple guides, requiring extensive cross-referencing
3. **Maintenance Burden**: Updates require changes in multiple locations, increasing risk of inconsistency
4. **Role Confusion**: Different DSPy roles (Planner, Implementer, Researcher, Coder) struggle to find relevant information quickly
5. **Constitution Integration**: Critical policies are buried in multiple locations rather than prominently displayed

### **Why does it matter?**
- **AI Efficiency**: Poor scanning efficiency reduces AI agent productivity and context comprehension
- **Human Experience**: Developers spend excessive time navigating between guides to find information
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Inconsistent updates lead to documentation drift and broken cross-references
- **Quality Risk**: Scattered critical policies increase risk of safety violations and governance failures
- **Scalability**: Current structure doesn't scale well as new guides and content are added

### **What's the opportunity?**
- **Streamlined Navigation**: Logical flow that guides users through natural progression
- **Enhanced AI Comprehension**: Optimized structure for AI scanning and context retrieval
- **Reduced Maintenance**: Single sources of truth with clear ownership and update patterns
- **Improved Safety**: Prominent constitution integration with clear policy visibility
- **Better Scalability**: Framework that accommodates growth without structural degradation

## **2. Strategic Analysis**

### **Current State Assessment**

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive coverage of all development aspects
- Strong constitution and governance framework
- Role-based context retrieval system
- Automated memory rehydration capabilities
- Cross-reference system with explicit linking

**Weaknesses:**
- Inconsistent logical flow between guides
- Critical policies scattered across multiple locations
- Redundant content and overlapping responsibilities
- Complex navigation patterns for different user types
- Maintenance burden from cross-reference management

**Opportunities:**
- Leverage existing memory system for improved context delivery
- Implement progressive disclosure patterns for different user needs
- Create clear ownership boundaries for guide maintenance
- Optimize for both human and AI consumption patterns
- Establish clear update patterns and governance

**Threats:**
- Risk of breaking existing cross-references during restructuring
- Potential loss of context during transition period
- Resistance to change from established patterns
- Complexity of maintaining backward compatibility

### **Strategic Objectives**

1. **Optimize for Dual Consumption**: Structure guides for both human reading and AI scanning
2. **Implement Progressive Disclosure**: Layer information from essential to detailed
3. **Establish Clear Ownership**: Define single sources of truth for each topic area
4. **Enhance Constitution Integration**: Make critical policies prominently accessible
5. **Improve Maintenance Patterns**: Create clear update workflows and validation
