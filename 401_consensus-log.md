# Consensus Log

This document tracks major architectural decisions and consensus checkpoints.

## Consensus Checkpoint — Vector Store Split (Core vs Perf)

**Date:** 2025-08-17
**Context:** Shadow fork validator identified `vector_store.py` and `enhanced_vector_store.py` as potential duplicates.
**Decision:** Files serve complementary purposes, not duplicates → canonicalized split.

**Resolution:**
- `core.py` → CoreVectorStore (stable API, hybrid search)
- `perf.py` → PerfVectorStore (performance, monitoring, caching, health checks)
- `protocols.py` + `factory.py` added for unified interface
- Shim `enhanced_vector_store.py` with pragma + deprecation during migration

**Governance:**
- Shadow fork validator WARN → FAIL after migration
- Docs Impact validator requires updates for vector store changes
- PR template updated with docs checklist

**Impact:**
- Both APIs preserved as first-class implementations
- Prevents future shadow forks through canonical structure
- Documentation discipline enforced for architectural changes
- Factory pattern provides explicit mode selection (core vs perf)

**Technical Details:**
- CoreVectorStore wraps HybridVectorStore (dense+sparse fusion, spans)
- PerfVectorStore wraps EnhancedVectorStore (PGVector + metrics, cache, health, index mgmt)
- Factory: `get_vector_store(mode="core|perf")` with env fallback
- Protocol: Minimal shared surface (add_documents, similarity_search, get_stats, get_health_status)
