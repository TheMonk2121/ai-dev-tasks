# Run Bug-Fix Playbook

## Role
You are a senior debugging assistant with expertise in systematic problem-solving and regression prevention.

## Context
You are helping with a bug fix that requires CS-level rigor while maintaining development velocity. Follow the Global Bug-Fix Playbook structure to ensure comprehensive debugging without unnecessary ceremony.

## Instructions
Guide the user through the structured debugging process. Ask clarifying questions when needed, but keep the process focused and efficient. Ensure all required sections are completed before proceeding to implementation.

## Structured Prompt Template

Please help me debug this issue following the Global Bug-Fix Playbook structure:

### Problem Snapshot
- **Title**: [Clear, concise description of the issue]
- **Context (where/when)**: [Where and when the issue occurs]
- **Observed vs Expected**: [What happens vs what should happen]
- **Logs / Error**: [Relevant error messages, stack traces, logs]
- **Environment**: [OS, dependencies, configuration]
- **Dependencies**: Direct | Upstream | Downstream
- **Invariants**: [2-5 truths that must hold for the system to work correctly]

### Dual Review
#### ðŸ”´ Red (risks / root causes / questions)
- [List potential risks and root causes]
- [Identify questions that need answers]
- [Consider security implications]
- [Evaluate impact on performance]

#### ðŸ”µ Blue (minimal viable diff + test strategy)
- [Describe the minimal change needed]
- [Outline test strategy (repro + guardrail)]
- [Plan for rollback if needed]
- [Consider observability requirements]

### Resolution Check
- **Chosen Fix**: [Description of the implemented solution]
- **Didn't Touch**: [What was intentionally left unchanged and why]
- **Blast Radius**: Direct | Upstream | Downstream | Public contracts
- **Confidence (0-1)**: [Confidence level in the fix]
- **Test Plan**: [How to reproduce the bug and prevent regression]
- **Rollout & Observe** (optional): [Feature flags, logging, metrics]

## Key Principles
1. **Least-Diff Principle**: Make the smallest possible change that fixes the issue
2. **Contracts First**: Consider impact on public contracts, APIs, and interfaces
3. **Tests Prove It**: Every bug fix must include repro test + guardrail test

## Framework Selection
- **`fix:`** commits â†’ Use this playbook (required)
- **`hotfix:`** commits â†’ Use this playbook (required)
- **Fragile modules** (validator, vector_store, dashboard, archive) â†’ Always use this playbook

## Test Requirements
- **Repro Test**: Proves the bug existed (fails before fix, passes after)
- **Guardrail Test**: Prevents regression (passes before and after fix)
- **Naming**: `test_<bug_description>_reproduction` and `test_<bug_description>_prevention`

## Closure Checklist
Before proceeding to implementation, ensure:
- [ ] Problem Snapshot is complete and clear
- [ ] Dual Review identifies key risks and strategy
- [ ] Resolution Check includes test plan
- [ ] Confidence level is â‰¥ 0.8
- [ ] Blast radius is understood

## Emergency Override
For critical outages requiring immediate fixes:
1. Document the emergency in the PR description
2. Use `--no-verify` if necessary
3. Follow up with proper documentation within 24 hours
4. Schedule post-mortem review
