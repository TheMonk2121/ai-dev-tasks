# ChatGPT Pro Research Directory

This directory contains research findings, reference links, and insights from ChatGPT Pro research sessions for the AI development ecosystem project.

## Organization Principles

### File Naming Convention
- `YYYY-MM-DD-session-name.md` - For individual research sessions
- `topic-name-research-summary.md` - For topic-specific research summaries
- `chatgpt-pro-research-log.md` - Master log of all research sessions

### Cross-Referencing
- Link to relevant existing research files in `docs/research/articles/`
- Reference related backlog items and PRDs
- Include implementation notes and next steps

### Structure
Each research session file should include:
- **Date and Session Info**: When the research was conducted
- **Research Type**: Regular or Deep research
- **Topic**: What was researched
- **Reference Links**: All links provided by ChatGPT Pro with descriptions
- **Key Findings**: Summary of main insights
- **Implementation Notes**: How findings apply to our project
- **Next Steps**: Action items and follow-up research needed

## Current Research Sessions

- `2025-01-28-mathematical-framework-implementation.md` - Category Theory and Coalgebras for AI System Mapping (B-1034)

## Integration with Existing Research

This directory complements existing research files:
- `../articles/dspy-articles.md` - DSPy-related research
- `../articles/agent-orchestration-articles.md` - Agent orchestration research
- `../articles/monitoring-articles.md` - Monitoring and observability research
- `../articles/performance-articles.md` - Performance optimization research
- `../articles/rag-articles.md` - RAG system research

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Before Research**: Check existing files for related research
2. **During Research**: Capture all reference links and key insights
3. **After Research**: Cross-reference with existing research and update related files
4. **Implementation**: Link research findings to backlog items and PRDs
