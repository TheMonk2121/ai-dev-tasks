## ðŸ“š **Papers**

### **"Searching for Best Practices in RAG" (ACL 2024)**

- **Authors**: ACL 2024 Research Team

- **Key Insight**: Hybrid search (dense + sparse) significantly improves RAG performance

- **Application**: Informs our hybrid search implementation with PGVector + PostgreSQL full-text

- **Citation**: [Full citation to be added]

- **Key Findings**:
  - Relying solely on vector similarity can miss exact matches or rare terms
  - Combined dense vectors (semantic recall) + sparse search (BM25/keyword) for precise matches
  - Significantly improves real-world QA recall compared to pure vector search
  - Many vector DBs (like Qdrant) added BM25 in 2024

### **Microsoft GraphRAG (2024)**

- **Authors**: Microsoft Research

- **Key Insight**: Knowledge graphs can augment traditional RAG for complex reasoning

- **Application**: Guides our knowledge graph integration approach

- **Citation**: [Full citation to be added]

- **Key Findings**:
  - Use LLMs to build knowledge graphs from document corpus
  - Multi-hop reasoning through relationships that pure vector search misses
  - Integrate structured and unstructured information
  - Handle queries requiring connecting disparate facts

### **KAG: Knowledge-Augmented Generation (2024)**

- **Authors**: [Research Team]

- **Key Insight**: Advanced knowledge integration techniques

- **Application**: Guides our knowledge integration approach

- **Citation**: [Full citation to be added]
