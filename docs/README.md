## 🎯 **Three-Lens Documentation System**

This documentation is organized using a **three-lens system** that provides different levels of detail for different audiences:

### **🔍 Beginner Lens** (Non-Technical)
**For**: Stakeholders, new team members, business users
**Purpose**: Understand what we're building and why it matters
**Content**: High-level vision, business value, user benefits

### **🔧 Intermediate Lens** (Technical but Accessible)
**For**: Developers, product managers, technical leads
**Purpose**: Understand how the system works and its components
**Content**: Architecture overview, workflows, key technologies

### **⚙️ Advanced Lens** (Deep Technical)
**For**: Core developers, architects, technical contributors
**Purpose**: Implement and extend the system
**Content**: Code architecture, technical decisions, implementation patterns
