{"case_id":"why_path_tsv","query":"Why did we add documents.path_tsv and use ts_rank(..., 32) in retrieval?","answers":["To rank by directory semantics with a GIN-indexed tsvector and normalize for length so long prose doesn't dominate."],"tag":"rag_qa_single"}
{"case_id":"bm25_hints_policy","query":"Why do we keep BM25 'pure' and put hints only in short/title?","answers":["Appending hint bags to BM25 flattens tf-idf and lets generic docs win; short/title hinting boosts precision without distorting BM25."],"tag":"rag_qa_single"}
