### Airport Plan

Let's figure out what time we need to leave home in order to catch a flight.

We know it's going to leave at 2:35pm, but Calca doesn't have a nice way to write times (yet!), so we're going to write 2:35pm in a funny way:

    take off time = 14 hours + 35 mins
    
We are using military time with hours and minutes separated using different units.

Now let's create a schedule:

    preparation time +=
            
      boarding = 30 mins
      bathroom =  5 mins
      dining   = 20 mins
      security = 40 mins
      checkin  = 20 mins
      drive    = 50 mins
        
    leave home time 
      = take off time - preparation time in hours
      => 11.83333 hours

We now know that we need to leave home at `11.83 hours`, but when is that? It's 11am, but home many minutes is `0.83`?

We can use the Time of Day `tod` function to display this time:
    
    tod(leave home time) => 11 hr + 50 mins
    
And there we have it, we should leave home at 11:50am.
