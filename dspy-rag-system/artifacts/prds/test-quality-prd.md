## 0. Project Context & Implementation Guide

### Current Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.12, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, pgvector
- **Frontend**: NiceGUI, HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Local-first development
- **Development**: Poetry, pytest, pre-commit, Ruff, Pyright

### Repository Layout
```

├── 000_core/              # Core workflow templates and backlog
├── 100_memory/            # Memory context and LTST system

└── scripts/               # Utility scripts and automation
```

### Development Patterns
- **Models**: `dspy-rag-system/src/models/` - Data models and business logic
- **Services**: `dspy-rag-system/src/services/` - Business services and utilities
- **Monitoring**: `dspy-rag-system/src/monitoring/` - Performance monitoring and metrics
- **Workflows**: `dspy-rag-system/src/workflows/` - Workflow automation and templates

### Local Development
```bash
# Setup
cd dspy-rag-system
poetry install
poetry run pre-commit install

# Run tests
poetry run pytest

# Start development server
poetry run python src/main.py
```

### Common Tasks
- **Add new workflow**: Create template in `000_core/`, add generator in `src/workflows/`
- **Add new monitoring**: Add collector in `src/monitoring/`, update schema
- **Add new service**: Create service in `src/services/`, add tests
- **Add new model**: Create model in `src/models/`, add database migration


## 1. Problem Statement

### What's broken?
Upgrade code review process with performance reporting and quality gates

### Why does it matter?
This backlog item addresses a critical need in the AI development ecosystem workflow.

### What's the opportunity?
Successfully implementing this will improve workflow efficiency and developer productivity.

## 2. Solution Overview

### What are we building?
Code Review Process Upgrade

### How does it work?
The solution will integrate with existing workflow components and follow established patterns.

### What are the key features?
- Feature 1: [To be defined based on specific backlog item]
- Feature 2: [To be defined based on specific backlog item]
- Feature 3: [To be defined based on specific backlog item]

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

### How do we know it's done?
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Performance requirements are satisfied
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Documentation is updated

### What does success look like?
- Workflow completes successfully within performance thresholds
- All quality gates pass
- No regressions in existing functionality

### What are the quality gates?
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation updated

## 4. Technical Approach

### What technology?
- Python 3.12 for backend logic
- PostgreSQL with pgvector for data storage
- NiceGUI for dashboard interface
- Performance monitoring with custom collectors

### How does it integrate?
- Integrates with existing LTST memory system
- Connects to performance monitoring infrastructure
- Follows established workflow patterns

### What are the constraints?
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Performance overhead must be <5%
- Must work in local-first environment

## 5. Risks and Mitigation

### What could go wrong?
- **Risk 1**: Performance impact on existing workflows
- **Risk 2**: Integration complexity with existing systems
- **Risk 3**: Data migration challenges

### How do we handle it?
- **Mitigation 1**: Comprehensive performance testing and monitoring
- **Mitigation 2**: Incremental integration with feature flags
- **Mitigation 3**: Thorough testing and rollback procedures

### What are the unknowns?
- Exact performance impact on different workflow types
- Integration complexity with specific components
- User adoption and feedback

## 6. Testing Strategy

### What needs testing?
- Performance impact on workflow execution
- Integration with existing systems
- Data consistency and integrity
- Error handling and recovery

### How do we test it?
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for workflow end-to-end
- Performance benchmarks and load testing
- User acceptance testing

### What's the coverage target?
- >90% code coverage for new functionality
- 100% coverage for critical paths
- Performance regression testing

## 7. Implementation Plan

### What are the phases?
1. **Phase 1**: Design and planning (5 hours)
2. **Phase 2**: Implementation (8 hours)
3. **Phase 3**: Testing and validation (2 hours)

### What are the dependencies?
- Existing workflow infrastructure
- Performance monitoring system
- Database schema updates

### What's the timeline?
- Total estimated time: 16 hours
- Dependencies: B-1008
- Target completion: Based on priority and resource availability
