### **üèóÔ∏è v0.3.1 Ultra-Minimal Router Architecture**

```python
# Core Configuration

ENABLED_AGENTS = ["IntentRouter", "RetrievalAgent", "CodeAgent"]
MODELS = {
    "cursor-native": "warm",  # Always resident
    "specialized-code-agent": "lazy"  # Load on demand
}
FEATURE_FLAGS = {
    "DEEP_REASONING": 0,
    "CLARIFIER": 0
}
MEMORY_STORE = "postgres_diff_no_tombstones"
```

**Runtime Guard-Rails:**

- **RAM Pressure Checks**: Prevent memory exhaustion

- **Model Janitor**: Unload idle models automatically

- **Fast-Path Bypass**: Skip complex routing for simple queries

- **Progressive Complexity**: Add features only when needed

## **üîß Your Tech Stack: How It All Works Together**###**1. Cursor - Your AI-Powered Code Editor**-**What it is**: A code editor that has AI built right into it

- **What you're doing**: Using it to write and manage your AI system

- **Why it's cool**: You can ask it to help you write code, just like you're doing right now!

### **2. Cursor Native AI - Your AI Brain**-**What it is**: Built-in AI models within Cursor IDE

- **How you're running it**: Natively in Cursor IDE

- **What it does**: Takes your questions and generates intelligent answers

### **3. DSPy - Your AI's Programming Framework**-**What DSPy is**: A framework that helps you program AI models more systematically

- **What it does for you**:
  - **Structures your AI interactions**- Instead of just chatting, it creates organized workflows
  - **Improves prompt engineering**- Makes your AI prompts more effective and reliable
  - **Enables memory and learning**- Your AI can remember past interactions and learn from them
  - **Creates reusable components**- Build AI modules you can use over and over
  - **Pre-RAG and Post-RAG logic**- Intelligent query rewriting and answer synthesis

### **4. RAG System - Your AI's Memory**-**What RAG means**: "Retrieval Augmented Generation" (fancy way of saying "find relevant info, then generate an answer")

- **How it works**:
  1. You ask a question
  2. **DSPy rewrites and decomposes**your question for better retrieval
  3. The system searches through your documents to find relevant information
  4. It gives that information to the AI foundation
  5.**DSPy synthesizes**the answer with Chain-of-Thought or ReAct reasoning
  6. The AI foundation generates an answer based on your documents

### **5. Vector Database (PostgreSQL) - Your AI's Filing Cabinet**-**What it is**: A special database that stores your documents in a way that makes them easy to search

- **How it works**:
  - Breaks your documents into small pieces (chunks)
  - Converts each piece into numbers (vectors) that represent meaning
  - When you ask a question, it finds the most similar pieces

- **Why it's smart**: It can find relevant information even if you don't use the exact same words

## **üöÄ How DSPy Makes This Different from ChatGPT**

### **ChatGPT (Standard LLM):**

```text
You: "What's in my documents?"
ChatGPT: "I don't have access to your documents. I can only help with general knowledge."
```

### **Your Enhanced DSPy RAG System:**

```text
You: "What's in my documents?"
DSPy RAG:
1. **Pre-RAG**: Rewrites and decomposes your question
2. Searches your actual documents with optimized queries
3. Finds relevant information using vector similarity
4. **Post-RAG**: Uses Chain-of-Thought or ReAct reasoning
5. Gives you: "Based on your documents, here's what I found..."
```

## **üîç How DSPy Works with Your Tools**

### **The Enhanced DSPy Pipeline:**

```text
Your Question ‚Üí DSPy Pre-RAG ‚Üí Vector Search ‚Üí DSPy Post-RAG ‚Üí AI ‚Üí Answer
```

### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **You ask a question** ‚Üí "Who has the highest salary?"
2. **DSPy Pre-RAG** ‚Üí Rewrites to "Find employee with maximum salary value"
3. **Vector Search** ‚Üí Finds relevant CSV data and documents
4. **DSPy Post-RAG** ‚Üí Uses Chain-of-Thought reasoning
5. **AI** ‚Üí Generates answer: "Based on the data, John Smith has the highest salary at $85,000"

## **üéØ Why DSPy Makes This Powerful**###**vs. Standard ChatGPT:**|**ChatGPT**|**Your DSPy RAG System**|
|-------------|---------------------------|
| ‚ùå No access to your files | ‚úÖ Reads your actual documents |
| ‚ùå Generic responses | ‚úÖ Answers based on your data |
| ‚ùå No memory of past chats | ‚úÖ Remembers everything you've shown it |
| ‚ùå Can't learn from your data | ‚úÖ Learns from your documents |
| ‚ùå Requires internet | ‚úÖ Runs completely on your computer |

### **vs. Basic RAG Systems:**|**Basic RAG**|**Your DSPy RAG**|
|---------------|-------------------|
| ‚ùå Simple prompt/response | ‚úÖ Structured AI programming |
| ‚ùå No learning capability | ‚úÖ Can improve over time |
| ‚ùå Fixed interactions | ‚úÖ Reusable AI modules |
| ‚ùå Limited memory | ‚úÖ Persistent memory in PostgreSQL |

## **Real-World Example**

*You have a CSV file with employee data:*

```csv
Name, Age, City, Occupation, Salary
John Smith, 32, New York, Software Engineer, 85000
Sarah Johnson, 28, San Francisco, Data Scientist, 95000
```

**You ask:** "Who has the highest salary?"

**DSPy RAG System:**
1. **DSPy RAG System** receives your question
2. **Vector search** finds the CSV data chunks
3. **DSPy prepares** a structured prompt for the AI foundation
4. **AI** analyzes the data and answers: "Sarah Johnson has the highest salary at $95,000"
5. **DSPy returns** the structured response with sources

## **üîç Why This Is Revolutionary**

### **For Beginners:**
- **No coding required** to ask questions
- **Drag and drop** files to add them
- **Natural language** questions (no special syntax)
- **Automatic processing** - just drop files and they're ready to query
- **Better than ChatGPT** - actually reads your documents!

### **For Junior Techs:**
- **Programmable AI** - DSPy lets you create reusable AI components
- **Structured workflows** - organized, predictable AI interactions
- **Local processing** - your data stays on your computer
- **Extensible system** - easy to add new capabilities
- **Memory persistence** - AI remembers past interactions

## **üìä What You've Accomplished**

‚úÖ **65+ document chunks** stored and searchable
‚úÖ **Multiple file types** supported (.txt, .md, .pdf, .csv)
‚úÖ **Automatic processing** - just drop files in the watch folder
‚úÖ **Smart search** - finds relevant information quickly
‚úÖ **Local AI** - everything runs on your computer
‚úÖ **Interactive interface** - ask questions naturally
‚úÖ **DSPy integration** - programmable AI workflows
‚úÖ **Better than ChatGPT** - actually uses your documents!

## **üéâ The Bottom Line**

You've built a **programmable AI research assistant** that can:

- **Remember everything** you've shown it
- **Find relevant information** quickly
- **Answer questions** intelligently
- **Learn from your documents** automatically
- **Work better than ChatGPT** for your specific data

It's like having a super-smart assistant who's read all your files, can answer any question about them, and gets smarter over time!

üöÄ **The key difference**: ChatGPT is a general AI that doesn't know your data. Your DSPy RAG system is a specialized AI that knows everything in your documents and can answer questions about them intelligently.
