## ðŸ”Ž TL;DR
- Optimize latency/cost via caching, batching/async, index tuning
- Profile hot paths and set SLOs; monitor tokens and cache hits

 
## Key Findings
- Token and retrieval overhead dominate; caching and selective context cut latency/cost fast.
- PG indexes (HNSW/GIN FTS) and query plans materially affect retrieval time.
- Streaming responses improve perceived latency without hurting accuracy.

 
## Actionable Patterns
- Enable DSPy cache and batch embeddings; debounce repeated queries.
- Tune PG: add GIN for FTS and adjust vector index params; analyze plans.
- Stream responses for long generations; enforce context size limits.
