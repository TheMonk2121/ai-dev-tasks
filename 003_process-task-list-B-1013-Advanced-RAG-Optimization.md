## Error Handling

### Safety Rules
- **Database Changes**: Always pause for human review
- **Performance Regressions**: Stop execution and create HotFix task
- **Integration Failures**: Generate HotFix task and pause
- **Consecutive Failures**: Stop execution after 2 consecutive failures

### Recovery Process
1. Generate HotFix task with error details
2. Execute HotFix task
3. Retry original task
4. Continue normal execution

## Progress Tracking

### Simple Progress
- Count completed tasks: `[x]` vs total tasks
- Update progress in task list header
- Track blocked tasks: `[!]`

### Completion Validation
- All tasks marked `[x]` or `[!]`
- No tasks with status `[ ]`
- All "Done when" criteria validated
- 15%+ improvement in retrieval accuracy achieved
