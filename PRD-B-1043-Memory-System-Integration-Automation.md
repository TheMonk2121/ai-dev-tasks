### Development Patterns
- **Memory Components**: `src/utils/` - Memory rehydrator, conversation storage, decision evaluator
- **DSPy Modules**: `src/dspy_modules/` - RAG pipeline, optimizers, agents
- **Monitoring**: `src/monitoring/` - Performance collection, metrics, dashboards
- **Scripts**: `scripts/` - Memory rehydration, workflow automation

### Local Developmen
```bash
# Setup
cd dspy-rag-system
poetry install
poetry run pre-commit install

# Run tests
poetry run pytes

# Start database
docker-compose up -d postgres

# Run memory rehydration
./scripts/memory_up.sh
```

### Common Tasks
- **Add memory component**: Create in `src/utils/`, add to memory rehydrator
- **Add DSPy module**: Create in `src/dspy_modules/`, integrate with RAG pipeline
- **Add monitoring**: Create in `src/monitoring/`, add performance hooks
- **Update memory context**: Modify files in `100_memory/`, run memory rehydration

## 1. Problem Statement

### What's broken?
The sophisticated LTST Memory System exists but is completely disconnected from actual usage. DSPy agents only use static markdown files via `memory_up.sh`, while the advanced database-driven memory system with conversation storage, decision intelligence, and context merging sits unused. Conversations are not captured, decisions are not extracted, and session continuity is broken.

### Why does it matter?
This creates a massive infrastructure-usage gap where:
- **100% failure rate** in RAGAS evaluations (Failure@20 = 1.0)
- **0% recall** in memory retrieval (Recall@10 = 0)
- **No real-time learning** from conversations
- **No session continuity** across development sessions
- **Wasted investment** in sophisticated memory infrastructure

### What's the opportunity?
By bridging this gap, we can unlock:
- **Real-time conversation capture** and processing
- **Automatic decision extraction** and intelligence
- **Session continuity** across development sessions
- **User preference learning** and adaptation
- **Dramatic improvement** in RAGAS performance metrics
- **Full utilization** of the sophisticated LTST memory system

## 2. Solution Overview

### What are we building?
A comprehensive integration layer that connects DSPy agents to the LTST memory system, automatically captures conversations, extracts decisions, and maintains session continuity.

### How does it work?
1. **Cursor Chat Integration**: Automatic hook to capture conversations in real-time
2. **DSPy Agent Memory Integration**: Modify agents to use LTST memory instead of static files
3. **Real-time Decision Extraction**: Process conversations to extract and store decisions
4. **Session Continuity**: Maintain context across multiple development sessions
5. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor and optimize memory retrieval performance

### What are the key features?
- **Automatic conversation capture** from Cursor cha
- **Real-time decision extraction** and intelligence processing
- **DSPy agent memory integration** with LTST system
- **Session continuity** and user preference learning
- **Performance monitoring** and optimization
- **Backward compatibility** with existing static file system
