## 1. Problem Statement

**What's broken?** Current system uses DSPy 2.6.27 and needs to migrate to DSPy 3.0 for access to native features, but we need to ensure system stability before adding enhancements.

**Why does it matter?** DSPy 3.0 provides native assertion support, improved optimizers, and better performance, but migration carries risk of breaking existing functionality.

**What's the opportunity?** Establish a stable foundation for future DSPy 3.0 enhancements while maintaining current system reliability.

## 2. Solution Overview

**What are we building?** A conservative DSPy 3.0 migration that achieves parity with current system before any enhancements.

**How does it work?** Pin DSPy 3.0.x, run comprehensive smoke tests, and validate that all existing functionality works without regression.

**What are the key features?**
- DSPy 3.0.x pinning in requirements
- Comprehensive smoke test validation
- Baseline metrics capture
- Rollback safety mechanisms

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

**How do we know it's done?**
- All existing tests pass with DSPy 3.0.x
- All linters pass without new violations
- Documentation coherence validator passes
- Baseline metrics captured to eval/baseline.json

**What does success look like?**
- System achieves functional parity with DSPy 2.6.27
- No more than 10% regression in any metric
- All Tier-1/Tier-2 critical files pass quality gates

**What are the quality gates?**
- Test pass rate ≥ 90% (no more than 10% regression)
- Lint violations ≤ current baseline
- Documentation coherence maintained
- Import/configure operations successful

## 4. Technical Approach

**What technology?** DSPy 3.0.x, existing test infrastructure, current linting tools

**How does it integrate?** Direct replacement of DSPy version in requirements, no code changes

**What are the constraints?**
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- No new external dependencies
- Rollback capability required
- Performance impact ≤ 10%

## 5. Risks and Mitigation

**What could go wrong?**
- DSPy 3.0.x introduces breaking changes
- Performance regression beyond 10%
- Test failures due to API changes
- Import/configuration issues

**How do we handle it?**
- Immediate rollback to DSPy 2.6.27 if >10% regression
- Comprehensive baseline capture before migration
- Isolated test environment for validation
- Git branch for easy rollback

**What are the unknowns?**
- Specific DSPy 3.0.x breaking changes
- Performance impact on current workloads
- Compatibility with existing custom assertions

## 6. Testing Strategy

**What needs testing?**
- All existing unit tests
- Integration tests with current workflows
- Performance benchmarks
- Import/configuration scenarios

**How do we test it?**
- Run full test suite with DSPy 3.0.x
- Compare performance metrics against baseline
- Validate all import paths and configurations
- Test rollback procedure

**What's the coverage target?** 100% of existing test coverage maintained

## 7. Implementation Plan

**What are the phases?**
1. Environment preparation and baseline capture
2. DSPy 3.0.x pinning and smoke testing
3. Comprehensive validation and metrics capture
4. Rollback testing and documentation

**What are the dependencies?** B-1003 DSPy Multi-Agent System Implementation (completed)

**What's the timeline?** 3 points (approximately 6-8 hours)

## 8. Rollback Strategy

**Rollback Criteria:**
- >10% test regression
- >10% performance regression
- Critical import/configuration failures
- Lint violations increase

**Rollback Procedure:**
1. Revert to DSPy 2.6.27 in requirements
2. Restore baseline metrics
3. Document failure points
4. Create B-1006-A-HotFix for investigation

## 9. Success Metrics

**Baseline Metrics to Capture:**
- Test pass rate %
- Median latency per role (Planner, Coder)
- Token count per run (avg ± variance)
- Doc coherence score
- Lint violations count

**Acceptable Thresholds:**
- Test pass rate: ≥90% (no more than 10% regression)
- Performance: ≤10% latency increase
- Quality: No new lint violations
- Stability: All imports/configurations work
