# Task List: B-1006 DSPy 3.0 Migration

## Overview

Migrate from DSPy 2.6.27 to DSPy 3.0 to leverage native assertion support, enhanced optimization capabilities, and MLflow integration while maintaining all existing advanced custom features. This migration will replace the custom assertion framework with native `dspy.Assert` support, integrate enhanced optimization techniques, and add MLflow experiment tracking. **Schema compatibility confirmed** - existing signatures and field definitions work identically in DSPy 3.0, requiring no schema changes.
