## RAG Lessons from Jerry (LlamaIndex talk) {#rag-lessons-from-jerry}

**Why this matters**  
Naive RAG fails on complex docs; advanced parsing + multi-representation + reflection reduces hallucinations. We map these lessons to governance scaffolding to prevent "naive governance".

**Key principles â†’ Repo mappings**
- *Garbage in, garbage out* â†’ Phase 0 backlog validator; PRD template hygiene.
- *Multi-representations per node* (table, caption, summary) â†’ Backlog/PRD items must have raw + summary + refs (B-100).
- *Page-level chunking as strong baseline* â†’ Treat Consensus Checkpoints as semantic "page-chunks" in `.ai_state.jsonl`.
- *Reflection layers* (retrieval + synthesis) â†’ Validator + post-mortem lessons at each consensus round.
- *Routing by query type* â†’ Adaptive routing (B-101) for pointed vs. broad decisions.

**Adopted backlog items**
- **B-100**: Multi-representation indexing (raw + summary + refs)
- **B-101**: Adaptive routing (pointed vs. broad queries)
- **B-102**: Cross-reference enforcement (traceability)

## Multi-representation Indexing {#multi-representation-indexing}

**Context**: From RAG research showing that storing multiple representations of the same content improves retrieval accuracy.

**Implementation**: Each backlog/PRD item stores:
1. **Raw**: The original content (backlog row, PRD document)
2. **Summary**: Structured metadata (scores, totals, key metrics)
3. **References**: Cross-links to lessons and external evidence

**Benefits**:
- Better semantic search across different query types
- Improved context retrieval for AI agents
- Reduced hallucination through multiple validation layers
