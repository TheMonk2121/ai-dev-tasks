# üìù Create PRD

## üîé TL;DR {#tldr}

| what this file is | read when | do next |
|---|---|---|
| Enhanced Product Requirements Document creation with industry standards and solo developer optimizations | Starting new feature development | Run workflow to generate PRD for selected backlog item |

## üéØ **Current Status**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **ACTIVE** - Enhanced PRD creation workflow with industry standards
- **Priority**: üî• Critical - Essential for project planning
- **Points**: 4 - Moderate complexity, high importance
- **Dependencies**: 000_core/000_backlog.md
- **Next Steps**: Enhanced template with MoSCoW prioritization and solo optimizations

## When to use {#when-to-use}

- Use for high-risk or 5+ point items, or when score_total < 3.0
- Optional for smaller items where acceptance criteria are obvious
- **B-1009**: AsyncIO Scribe Enhancement (6 points, score_total: 6.5) - PRD required
- **B-1010**: NiceGUI Scribe Dashboard (8 points, score_total: 7.0) - PRD required

### PRD Skip Rule (canonical) {#prd-skip-rule}

- Skip PRD when: points < 5 AND score_total ‚â• 3.0 (backlog metadata `<!--score_total: X.X-->`)
- Otherwise, create a PRD with machine-verifiable acceptance criteria

### Backlog Integration {#backlog-integration}

- **Input**: Backlog item ID (e.g., B-1007) or PRD file
- **Output**: PRD file following enhanced template structure
- **Cross-reference**: `000_core/000_backlog.md` for item details and metadata

## 0. Project Context & Implementation Guide
### Current Tech Stack
- **Backend**: [e.g., Python 3.12, FastAPI, PostgreSQL]
- **AI/ML**: [e.g., Cursor Native AI, DSPy, LTST Memory]
- **Infrastructure**: [e.g., Docker, Redis, n8n workflows]
- **Development**: [e.g., Poetry, pytest, pre-commit, Ruff]

### Repository Layout
```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 100_memory/            # Memory and context systems
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 200_setup/             # Setup and configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 400_guides/            # Documentation and guides

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                 # Test files
```

### Development Patterns
- **Add backlog item**: `scripts/backlog_intake.py` ‚Üí update `000_core/000_backlog.md`
- **Generate PRD**: `scripts/prd_generator.py` ‚Üí create `PRD-B-XXX.md`
- **Execute workflow**: `scripts/solo_workflow.py` ‚Üí automated 001-003 flow
- **Update memory**: `scripts/update_cursor_memory.py` ‚Üí maintain context

### Local Developmen
```bash
# Setup
poetry install
poetry run pre-commit install

# Quality gates
poetry run pytest              # Run tests
poetry run black .             # Format code
poetry run ruff check .        # Lint code
poetry run mypy .              # Type check

# Backlog operations
python3 scripts/backlog_cli.py add "description"  # Add item
python3 scripts/backlog_cli.py update B-XXX       # Update item
python3 scripts/backlog_cli.py close B-XXX        # Close item
```

## **Special Instructions**

### Implementation Focus (Enhanced)
1. **Keep it simple** - Focus on what actually matters
2. **Be honest** - Call out real problems and risks
3. **Be specific** - Clear, testable acceptance criteria
4. **Be realistic** - Honest timeline and effort estimates
5. **Consider dependencies** - What needs to happen firs
6. **Think about testing** - How do we know it works?
7. **Identify risks** - What could go wrong?
8. **Align with backlog** - Use backlog priorities and scoring
9. **Parse backlog format** - Extract relevant metadata
10. **Use points for effort** - Scale tasks to point estimates
11. **Capture project context** - Document current tech stack and patterns
12. **Include MoSCoW prioritization** - Must/Should/Could/Won't categorization
13. **Optimize for solo developer** - One-command workflows and auto-advance
14. **Consider industry standards** - Best practices for maintainability
15. **Plan for knowledge mining** - How completed work informs future planning
16. **Design for visual interface** - Consider dashboard and Kanban integration
17. **Account for dynamic reprioritization** - AI-driven priority adjustments
18. **Include context preservation** - LTST memory integration
19. **Plan for archive system** - Systematic organization with insights
20. **Consider performance implications** - Scalability and optimization needs

## Acceptance Criteria {#acceptance-criteria}

This enhanced approach ensures every PRD focuses on what actually matters: clear problems, simple solutions, realistic plans, honest assessment of risks and challenges, industry best practices, and solo developer optimizations.

## Handoff to task generation {#handoff-to-002}

- Next step: Use `000_core/002_generate-tasks.md` with this PRD (or a Backlog ID)
- Input ‚Üí PRD file with embedded tasks; Output ‚Üí Execution-ready configuration
- **Streamlined approach**: PRD contains tasks, 003 contains execution configuration
