### Development Patterns
- **Add workflow template**: `000_core/` → create template → update dependencies
- **Add DSPy module**: `src/dspy_modules/` → add module → add tests
- **Add automation script**: `scripts/` → add script → add CLI interface → add tests
- **Add artifact**: `artifacts/` → create in appropriate subdirectory → update cross-references

### Local Development
```bash
# Setup
poetry install
poetry run pre-commit install

# Quality gates
poetry run pytest              # Run tests
poetry run ruff check .        # Lint code
poetry run pyright .           # Type check
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files  # Run all quality gates
```

### Common Tasks Cheat Sheet
- **Add new workflow**: Template → PRD → Task List → Execution Plan
- **Enhance existing system**: Identify component → Add tests → Implement → Validate
- **Add performance monitoring**: Identify bottleneck → Add metrics → Implement monitoring → Validate improvement
- **Update backlog**: Parse item → Update status → Generate artifacts → Archive completed

## 1. Problem Statement

### What's broken?
The current code review process lacks systematic performance reporting and optimization capabilities. The 001_create-prd workflow needs performance metrics integration to ensure it's as efficient as possible for the solo developer workflow.

### Why does it matter?
Without performance monitoring, we can't identify bottlenecks in the PRD creation process, leading to inefficient development cycles and potential scalability issues as the project grows.

### What's the opportunity?
By implementing comprehensive performance reporting, we can optimize the 001_create-prd workflow, reduce development friction, and create a canonical code review process that serves as a model for future workflow enhancements.

## 2. Solution Overview

### What are we building?
A comprehensive code review testing suite with performance reporting that optimizes the 001_create-prd workflow and establishes a canonical code review process.

### How does it work?
The solution integrates performance metrics collection into the existing 001_create-prd workflow, adds automated testing capabilities, and creates a standardized code review process with integrated performance monitoring.

### What are the key features?
- Performance metrics collection and reporting
- Automated testing suite for code review processes
- Canonical code review process with quality gates
- Integration with existing DSPy and LTST memory systems
- Solo developer optimizations for streamlined workflow

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

### How do we know it's done?
- 001_create-prd workflow optimized and performance metrics integrated
- Canonical code review process with integrated performance monitoring and automated testing suite
- Performance improvements measurable and documented
- Integration with existing systems seamless and non-breaking

### What does success look like?
- Reduced PRD creation time by measurable percentage
- Comprehensive test coverage for code review processes
- Clear performance benchmarks and monitoring capabilities
- Established canonical process that can be replicated for other workflows

### What are the quality gates?
- All existing tests pass without regression
- Performance metrics show measurable improvement
- Integration with LTST memory system maintained
- Documentation updated with new process details

## 4. Technical Approach

### What technology?
- **Performance Monitoring**: Custom metrics collection using existing monitoring infrastructure
- **Testing Framework**: pytest with custom fixtures for workflow testing
- **Integration**: DSPy modules for intelligent performance analysis
- **Reporting**: NiceGUI dashboard integration for performance visualization

### How does it integrate?
- Extends existing 001_create-prd workflow without breaking changes
- Integrates with LTST memory system for context preservation
- Uses existing DSPy infrastructure for intelligent analysis
- Connects to NiceGUI dashboard for performance reporting

### What are the constraints?
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing workflow
- Performance overhead must be minimal (<5% impact)
- Must work within existing local-first architecture
- Must integrate with existing quality gates and pre-commit hooks

## 5. Risks and Mitigation

### What could go wrong?
- Performance monitoring adds overhead that slows down the workflow
- Integration complexity could break existing functionality
- Testing suite might not cover all edge cases
- Performance metrics might not provide actionable insights

### How do we handle it?
- Implement lightweight performance collection with minimal overhead
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout and easy rollback
- Comprehensive testing with edge case coverage
- Validate metrics provide actionable insights before full deployment

### What are the unknowns?
- Exact performance improvement achievable
- Optimal metrics collection frequency
- Best visualization approach for performance data
- Integration complexity with existing DSPy modules

## 6. Testing Strategy

### What needs testing?

- Workflow integration and backward compatibility
- Dashboard visualization and reporting
- Edge cases in PRD creation process

### How do we test it?
- Unit tests for performance collection components

- Performance benchmarks with realistic data sets
- User acceptance testing for dashboard usability

### What's the coverage target?
- 90% code coverage for new components
- 100% coverage for critical performance collection paths
- Integration test coverage for all workflow touchpoints
- Performance benchmark validation for all metrics
