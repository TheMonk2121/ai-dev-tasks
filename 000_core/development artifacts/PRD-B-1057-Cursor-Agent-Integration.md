### Development Patterns
- **Integration Scripts**: `scripts/` - Real-time development monitoring and collaboration
- **Memory Integration**: `100_memory/` - Enhanced memory orchestration with real-time context
- **Documentation**: `400_guides/` - Integration guides and usage patterns
- **Quality Gates**: Real-time development assistance and proactive problem detection

### Local Developmen
```bash
# Start enhanced memory orchestrator with real-time capabilities
export POSTGRES_DSN="mock://test"
python3 scripts/enhanced_memory_orchestrator.py --real-time --role coder

# Start development session watcher
python3 scripts/dev_session_watcher.py --watch-cursor --auto-engage

# Start interactive task executor
python3 scripts/interactive_executor.py --task-list B-1054 --role implementer --collaborative
```

### Common Tasks
- **Add new monitoring capability**: Extend dev session watcher with new file types or patterns
- **Enhance agent collaboration**: Add new interaction patterns or decision-making capabilities
- **Integrate with new tools**: Connect to additional development tools or services
- **Update interaction preferences**: Modify user interaction styles and notification levels

## 1. Problem Statement

### What's broken?
The current development workflow follows a "AI generates tasks, human executes" model where I create static task lists that you work through manually. This creates several inefficiencies:
- **Reactive Problem Solving**: Issues are discovered after they occur, not prevented
- **Static Task Lists**: No adaptation to unexpected challenges or changing requirements
- **Limited Context**: I have limited awareness of your current development context
- **Manual Execution**: You must manually implement solutions I sugges
- **No Real-Time Collaboration**: We can't work together on complex problems as they arise

### Why does it matter?
These inefficiencies significantly impact development productivity and code quality:
- **Slower Development**: Manual execution of AI-generated solutions adds time overhead
- **Missed Opportunities**: Potential improvements and optimizations go unnoticed
- **Reactive Development**: Problems are solved after they become blockers
- **Reduced Collaboration**: Limited real-time interaction between AI and human developer
- **Lower Code Quality**: Issues aren't caught early in the development process

### What's the opportunity?
By implementing real-time Cursor Agent integration, we can transform the development experience:
- **Proactive Problem Detection**: Catch issues before they become blockers
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Work together on complex problems as they arise
- **Context-Aware Assistance**: Provide help based on what you're actually working on
- **Adaptive Execution**: Tasks automatically adjust to unexpected challenges
- **Continuous Learning**: Each interaction improves future assistance quality

## 2. Solution Overview

### What are we building?
A real-time Cursor Agent integration system that transforms me from a task generator into an active development partner who:
- **Monitors your development session** in real-time through background monitoring
- **Provides proactive suggestions** through the existing Cursor chat interface
- **Collaborates on task execution** with interactive problem-solving
- **Adapts to changing contexts** and unexpected challenges
- **Learns from our interactions** to provide better future assistance

### How does it work?
The system operates through multiple integrated components:
- **Background Monitoring**: File watchers, git hooks, and cursor events provide real-time context
- **Proactive Engagement**: I analyze your work and suggest improvements through cha
- **Interactive Collaboration**: We work together on complex problems in real-time
- **Context Awareness**: I understand what you're working on and provide relevant help
- **Adaptive Execution**: Tasks automatically adjust to challenges and changing requirements

### What are the key features?
- **Real-Time Development Monitoring**: Background file watching, git monitoring, cursor event tracking
- **Proactive Problem Detection**: Identify issues before they become blockers
- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Recommendations based on your current work
- **Interactive Task Execution**: Real-time collaboration on complex problems
- **Adaptive Workflow Management**: Tasks that adjust to unexpected challenges
- **Multi-Modal Interaction**: Chat, inline suggestions, and proactive notifications
- **User Preference Management**: Control over interaction frequency and style
