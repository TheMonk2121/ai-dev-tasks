## 1. Problem Statement

**What's broken?** Current RAG system lacks late chunking for context preservation and HIRAG-style hierarchical reasoning, limiting retrieval accuracy and generation quality compared to state-of-the-art research.

**Why does it matter?** The current system uses traditional chunking methods that split documents before embedding, leading to loss of contextual information. This reduces retrieval accuracy and prevents the system from leveraging the latest advances in RAG optimization.

**What's the opportunity?** Implementing late chunking and HIRAG integration can provide 15%+ improvement in retrieval accuracy and generation quality, creating a comprehensive RAG pipeline that excels at both retrieval accuracy and generation quality.

## 2. Solution Overview

**What are we building?** Advanced RAG optimization system that implements late chunking for context preservation and HIRAG-style hierarchical reasoning.

**How does it work?**
- **Late Chunking**: Process entire documents through long-context embedding models first, then apply semantic chunking just before mean pooling
- **HIRAG Integration**: Implement hierarchical thought processes with multi-level progressive chain-of-thought reasoning
- **Performance Optimization**: Leverage AsyncIO for parallel processing and entity expansion for enhanced semantic relationships

**What are the key features?**
- Full document context preservation during embedding
- Hierarchical reasoning with multi-level chain-of-though
- AsyncIO integration for performance optimization
- Seamless integration with existing DSPy optimization pipeline
- Entity expansion for enhanced semantic relationships

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

**How do we know it's done?**
- [ ] System implements late chunking preserving full document context
- [ ] HIRAG-style multi-level reasoning is integrated and functional
- [ ] 15%+ improvement in retrieval accuracy measured
- [ ] Seamless integration with existing DSPy optimization pipeline
- [ ] AsyncIO integration provides performance benefits
- [ ] Entity expansion maintains semantic relationships

**What does success look like?**
- Production-ready advanced RAG system with late chunking context preservation
- HIRAG hierarchical reasoning with measurable performance improvements
- 15%+ improvement in retrieval accuracy and generation quality
- Zero regressions in existing functionality

**What are the quality gates?**
- All existing tests pass with zero regressions
- Performance benchmarks meet or exceed targets
- Memory usage remains within acceptable limits
- Integration tests validate seamless operation

## 4. Technical Approach

**What technology?**
- **Late Chunking**: Long-context embedding models with semantic chunking
- **HIRAG**: Hierarchical thought processes with chain-of-thought reasoning
- **DSPy**: Integration with existing DSPy 3.0 optimization pipeline
- **AsyncIO**: Parallel processing for performance optimization
- **Entity Expansion**: Enhanced semantic relationship preservation

**How does it integrate?**
- Builds on existing DSPy 3.0 foundation (B-1006-A)
- Leverages AsyncIO Scribe Enhancement (B-1009)
- Integrates with memory rehydrator system
- Maintains compatibility with existing RAG pipeline

**What are the constraints?**
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing system
