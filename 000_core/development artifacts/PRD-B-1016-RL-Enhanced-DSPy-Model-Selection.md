## 1. Problem Statement

**What's broken?** The current DSPy model selection system uses static rules and manual configuration, which limits performance optimization and doesn'tt learn from experience. The system can't adapt to different task types, user preferences, or performance patterns. Model selection is based on fixed criteria rather than actual outcomes, leading to suboptimal performance and missed opportunities for improvement.

**Why does it matter?** Model selection directly impacts the quality and efficiency of AI interactions in the development ecosystem. Poor model selection leads to slower responses, lower quality outputs, and wasted computational resources. As a solo developer, I need optimal AI performance to maximize productivity and maintain focus on high-impact work.

**What's the opportunity?** Implementing RL-enhanced model selection will create a self-improving system that learns optimal strategies through trial and error, automatically adapts to different contexts, and continuously optimizes performance. This will provide immediate performance improvements while building a foundation for advanced AI optimization.

## 2. Solution Overview

**What are we building?** An RL-enhanced DSPy model selection system that uses reinforcement learning to optimize model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance-based evolution. The system will learn from success/failure patterns and automatically improve over time.

**How does it work?** The system will:
1. **RL Agent Integration**: Add reinforcement learning agent to existing model switcher
2. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor model performance and user satisfaction
3. **Reward Function**: Define rewards based on response quality, speed, and user feedback
4. **Environment Design**: Create RL environment that represents model selection decisions
5. **Policy Optimization**: Use policy gradient methods to optimize selection strategies
6. **Continuous Learning**: Enable ongoing improvement through experience

**Key Components**:
- **RL Agent**: Policy network for model selection decisions
- **Environment**: State representation of available models and context
- **Reward Function**: Performance-based reward calculation
- **Policy Optimization**: Training loop for continuous improvement
- **Performance Monitoring**: Metrics collection and analysis
- **Integration Layer**: Seamless integration with existing DSPy system

**What are the key features?**
1. **Self-Improving Model Selection**: Learns optimal strategies through trial and error
2. **Context-Aware Decisions**: Adapts selection based on task type and user context
3. **Performance Optimization**: Continuously optimizes for speed and quality
4. **Automatic Hyperparameter Tuning**: Learns optimal model configurations
5. **Real-Time Adaptation**: Adjusts strategies based on current performance
6. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Tracks performance metrics and learning progress

    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_dim, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 32)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(32, action_dim)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=-1)

    def forward(self, state):
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(state))
        x = self.relu(self.fc2(x))
        action_probs = self.softmax(self.fc3(x))
        return action_probs
```

### Environment Design
```python
# RL environment for model selection
class ModelSelectionEnvironment:
    def __init__(self, available_models, task_types):
        self.available_models = available_models
        self.task_types = task_types
        self.current_state = None

    def reset(self):
        # Initialize state with task context
        self.current_state = self._get_initial_state()
        return self.current_state

    def step(self, action):
        # Execute model selection and get reward
        reward = self._calculate_reward(action)
        next_state = self._get_next_state(action)
        done = self._is_episode_done()
        return next_state, reward, done, {}
```

### Reward Function
```python
# Performance-based reward calculation
def calculate_reward(model_performance, user_feedback, response_time):
    quality_score = model_performance.get('quality', 0.0)
    user_score = user_feedback.get('satisfaction', 0.0)
    time_penalty = max(0, (response_time - target_time) / target_time)

    reward = (quality_score * 0.4 + user_score * 0.4 - time_penalty * 0.2)
    return reward
```

    def select_model(self, task_context):
        try:
            # Use RL agent for model selection
            state = self.environment.get_state(task_context)
            action = self.rl_agent.select_action(state)
            model = self.available_models[action]
