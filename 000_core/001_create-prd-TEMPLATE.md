### Development Patterns
- **Evaluation Scripts**: `scripts/` - RAG evaluation implementations
- **Documentation**: `400_guides/` - Comprehensive usage guides and integration
- **Status Tracking**: `metrics/baseline_evaluations/` - Evaluation results and status
- **Quality Gates**: Integration with development workflow and CI/CD

### Local Development
```bash
# Verify RAGChecker installation
python3 -c "import ragchecker; print('✅ RAGChecker installed successfully!')"

# Verify spaCy model
python3 -c "import spacy; nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm'); print('✅ spaCy model loaded successfully!')"

# Run official evaluation
python3 scripts/ragchecker_official_evaluation.py

# Check evaluation status
cat metrics/baseline_evaluations/EVALUATION_STATUS.md
```

### Common Tasks
