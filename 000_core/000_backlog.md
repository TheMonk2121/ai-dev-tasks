### **B-1062: Unified Agentic Memory Architecture & Collaborative Agent Platform** 🆕 **NEW**
- **Priority**: 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Future enhancement after baseline stabilization
- **Points**: 12 - Very high complexity, strategic importance, comprehensive agentic platform
- **Status**: 🔒 **BLOCKED** - Blocked by RAGChecker baseline requirements (B-1059)
- **Description**: Implement a self-coherent, end-to-end agentic architecture where agents collaborate intelligently with unified memory system—balancing structured facts (SQL), semantic recall (pgvector), and relational depth (Knowledge Graph). Inspired by VE's AI Team Dashboard PRD and modern agentic architecture patterns.
- **Vision**: Create agents that don't just query, but collaborate intelligently with memory system. This isn't agents bolted on; it's agents woven into a unified operational doctrine with observability, replayability, and continuous feedback loops.
- **Scope**: Comprehensive agentic platform with four progressive phases:
  - **Phase 1**: TaskEnvelope Contracts & Enhanced Agent Bus - Pydantic-modeled TaskEnvelope with uniform contracts, enhanced `AgentCommunicationManager` with event system (Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY)
  - **Phase 2**: Three-Store Memory Coherence & Dynamic Context Management - ContextService for seamless retrieval across SQL/pgvector/KG with ChatGPT-inspired sliding window memory (recent full detail, summarized history, thematic highlights), background scribe agent for real-time note-taking and backlog linking, strict separation of truth with immutable artifacts and provenance tracking
  - **Phase 3**: Observability & Evaluation Integration - EvalService with RAGChecker integration, trace per-task joins, automatic repair workflows, health dashboards with orphan detection
  - **Phase 4**: Full Agentic Orchestration - Agent lifecycles (Task→Hydrate→Work→Write→Evaluate→Repair), scalable concurrency, governance with human-in-the-loop
- **Key Components**:
  - **TaskEnvelope**: Pydantic contracts (kind, context_refs, input, expected) for agent uniformity
  - **Enhanced Agent Bus**: Event-driven communication with Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY, hybrid async architecture (asyncio + Trio for structured concurrency, ProcessPoolExecutor for CPU-bound DSPy operations), task queuing with FastAPI coordination interface, polling fallback
  - **ContextService**: Unified hydration across SQL, pgvector, KG by (gid, version, content_hash) with ChatGPT-style sliding window memory managemen
  - **Background Scribe Agent**: Real-time conversation tracking, dynamic note-taking, automatic backlog item linking, thematic pattern detection
  - **ArtifactService**: Immutable agent outputs with metadata + provenance, content-hash deduplication
  - **EvalService**: RAGChecker integration, metrics logging, automatic repair triggers
  - **Agent Orchestration**: Stateless agents, limited concurrency (2-3 threads), DSPy-modular core logic
  - **Observability**: Trace joins (vector_ms, sql_ms, kg_ms), queue backlogs, daily health dashboards
  - **Repair Workflows**: Threshold-based automatic repair (e.g., expand retrieval, re-embed on epoch change)
- **Technical Architecture**:
  - **Memory Stores**: SQL (structured facts SSOT), pgvector (semantic pointers), KG (relationships)
  - **Agent Lifecycle**: Task→Hydrate→Work→Write→Evaluate→(Optional)Repair→Publish
  - **Concurrency**: Hybrid async model - asyncio for I/O-bound agent communication, ProcessPoolExecutor (2-3 workers) for CPU-bound DSPy operations, Trio for structured agent lifecycle management, async projections for hot context
  - **Contracts**: Immutable I/O schemas, ChatGPT-inspired tiered memory (recent full detail → summarized history → thematic highlights → long-term knowledge base)
  - **Provenance**: gid, version, content_hash ubiquitously passed for full traceability
- **Dependencies**: B-1063 (Agentic Framework Evaluation - PREREQUISITE), B-1059 (RAGChecker baseline improvement - CRITICAL BLOCKER), B-1003 (DSPy Multi-Agent System - COMPLETED), B-1049 (Pydantic Integration - COMPLETED)
- **Success Criteria**: Agent consensus accuracy >90%, memory coherence 100%, retrieval latency <500ms, eval thresholds met (citation confidence, retrieval scores), 0% RAGChecker baseline degradation
- **Integration Approach**: Progressive enhancement of existing infrastructure - builds on `AgentCommunicationManager`, LTST Memory System, DSPy Multi-Agent, PostgreSQL+pgvector, RAGChecker framework
- **Risk Mitigation**: Start minimal (TaskEnvelope + enhanced bus), expand only when flow breaks, concurrency throttling, layered adapters for future Redis/DAG scaling, enforce SSOT per data type
- **Expert Foundation**: Based on MemoryOS hierarchical memory, Cazton's immutable schemas, SuperAGI's four-phase workflows, FalkorDB's KG+Vector coherence patterns
- **Rationale**: Transforms agent layer from patchwork into feedback-driven, observable evolution platform. Agents become collaborators with trustworthy memory, not chaos with brittle state. Enables true AI team collaboration while maintaining operational discipline.

  - **Scalability**: Agent coordination capabilities, concurrent request handling, resource utilization
- **Dependencies**: B-1059 (RAGChecker baseline improvement - CRITICAL BLOCKER), B-1049 (Pydantic Integration - COMPLETED)
- **Success Criteria**: Clear winner identified with >20% advantage in weighted decision matrix, all frameworks achieve RAGChecker baseline compliance, comprehensive documentation of trade-offs and implementation paths
- **Integration Approach**: Builds evaluation harness on existing infrastructure - leverages RAGChecker framework, existing retriever, PostgreSQL+pgvector, maintains compatibility with current system
- **Risk Mitigation**: Time-boxed evaluation (4 points max), prototype-only implementations, maintains existing system stability, clear rollback to current approach if no clear winner
- **Strategic Impact**: Informs B-1062 implementation strategy - either validates custom architecture or pivots to proven framework, prevents over-engineering through evidence-based decision making
- **Rationale**: Before investing 12 points in custom B-1062 architecture, validate whether proven frameworks (LangGraph, LlamaIndex) provide superior results. Evidence-based evaluation prevents architectural regret and ensures optimal resource allocation.

- **Success Criteria**: Users can chat with individual AI agents, have group conversations with multiple agents, and all agents respond appropriately with access to memory system
- **Integration Approach**: Leverage existing infrastructure (multi-agent chat bridge, LTST memory, DSPy agents) and fix connection issues

  - **Backend Enhancements (effective vs. current)**:
    - Identity: accept `user_id`, optional `token`, and `room` on WS query; echo in message envelope; maintain per-connection maps.
    - Persistence: append messages to durable store (reuse `src/utils/conversation_storage.py` or a lightweight SQLite). Add `/messages?since=cursor&agent=…&room=…`.
    - LTST wiring: on inbound user messages, write-through to LTST; on agent send, fetch recent context via `src/retrieval/memory_integration.py` and attach to agent prompts/metadata.
    - Routing/controls: keep broadcast default; support explicit `target_agents` and `@mentions`; add simple per-connection rate limit and denylist for noisy types.
    - Health and tests: add pytest smoke for `/health`, `/send-message` ➜ `/messages`, and WS echo; basic load test for 100 msgs.
    - Dev launcher: one script to start bridge (8004) + web UI (8006) together.

  - **Frontend Enhancements (effective vs. current)**:
    - Identity panel: small sign-in to set `user_id` and optional token; persist in `localStorage`; include on WS URL.
    - Presence sidebar: list agents from `GET /agents`; click to insert @mention; live connection counts.
    - Target chips: show resolved recipients when mentions exist; remove chips to revert to broadcast.
    - Rooms: header dropdown bound to `GET /chat/rooms`; include `room` in WS query and filter history.
    - History/paging: “Load more” using `/messages?since=`; maintain scroll position.
    - Rendering: basic markdown (code/links), message badges (system/status/log), relative timestamps.
    - UX polish: toast errors, connection quality indicator (ping RTT), per-room draft persistence, optional desktop notifications on mentions, agent mute toggles.

  - **Security & Permissions**:
    - Validate `token` on connect (pluggable hook); drop/Throttle on abuse; basic per-IP/`user_id` limits.

  - **Acceptance Criteria (expanded)**:
    - Two browsers (distinct `user_id`s) + 3 agent sockets can chat; @mentions route correctly; “@all” broadcasts.
    - Refresh persists history and identity; “Load more” paginates; rooms filter works.
    - Messages appear in durable store and LTST (spot-check via a simple query or log).
    - CI smoke passes; manual test plan covers disconnect/reconnect, rate limiting, and malformed payloads.

- Config + light auto-fixes (30–60 minutes): Keep MD034 (no bare URLs) and MD040 (code fence language) enabled and fix
across repo. Replace bare URLs with `[text](url)`. Add language tags to fenced code blocks. Run
`scripts/fix_markdown_blanks.py` to settle heading/list spacing.
- Full cleanup (strict conformance without disabling) (2–4 hours): Remove inline HTML anchors, rework heading levels,
and normalize spacing across long-form guides.

<!-- outcome: Minimal, measurable memory pipeline: dense∪sparse union → local reranker → recency tiebreak; light facts; optional rolling summary; flags + rollback; A/B accepted with clear lift/budgets. -->

  - Plan (phased, minimal):
    - Phase 0 (Baseline & Flags):
      - Add feature flags: FEATURE_HYBRID, FEATURE_RERANK, FEATURE_ROLLING_SUMMARY, FEATURE_FACTS, FEATURE_BM25, FEATURE_HNSW.
      - Create eval set (100 real queries + golds) at `dspy-rag-system/tests/data/eval_queries.jsonl`.
      - Instrument `src/utils/memory_rehydrator.py` to log candidate counts, winner source, reranker deltas, p50/p90 latency to `logs/memory_eval.ndjson`.
      - Add `embedding_version`; no re‑embed yet.
    - Phase 1 (Schema):
      - Create `messages(id, thread_id, kind{turn|summary|chunk}, text, embedding, embedding_version, importance, created_at, last_accessed_at, access_count, fts generated column)` with GIN on `fts`. Keep pgvector exact (no ANN yet).
      - Create `facts(id, subject, predicate, object, confidence, source, is_active, version, last_seen_at, updated_at)` with unique (subject,predicate,version) and active lookup index.
    - Phase 2 (Hybrid Union):
      - `HybridRetriever` returns union of dense (pgvector exact) and sparse (FTS via `websearch_to_tsquery`) with de‑dup; optional RRF if reranker off.
    - Phase 3 (Reranker + Recency Tiebreak):
      - Local cross‑encoder (`BAAI/bge-reranker-base` ONNX INT8). Batch ~40 pairs → top 8–12. Apply recency only for near‑ties.
    - Phase 4 (Rolling Summary):
      - Update every 4–6 turns or idle ≥10s; cap 200–300 tokens; pin at prompt edge.
    - Phase 5 (Facts API):
      - `upsert_fact(subject, predicate, object, source)`: refresh on semantic‑same; version & supersede on contradiction; confirm for sensitive predicates.
      - Tiny CLI in `scripts/facts_cli.py`.
    - Phase 6 (A/B & Accept):
      - Harness compares LTST vs Hybrid+Rerank on Recall/MRR/NDCG@k and latency p50/p90; accept if lift meets gate and latency within budget.

  - Stop/Go Gates:
    - G1: Hybrid union returns in time; candidate diversity sane.
    - G2: Reranker lifts Recall/MRR; p50 within +300ms budget.
    - G3: Summary <300 tokens, reduces redundant turns.
    - G4: Facts stable (no ping‑pong contradictions).
    - G5: A/B acceptance → consider optional BM25/HNSW/pruner (behind flags).

  - Rollback:
    - Flip flags off to revert to LTST; keep new tables inert when flags are off.

  - Expanded exploration (first, avoid overfitting): Key decisions to test behind flags
    - Scratchpad capture approach: Cursor‑internal only vs proxy‑level vs both; choose proxy as source‑of‑truth.
    - Schema granularity: minimal lessons/decisions now vs full knowledge graph; start minimal with link edges.
    - Emission pattern: enforce `<scratchpad>` via Cursor Rules for local models vs optional; begin enforced for local only.
    - Storage: direct to Postgres vs observability vendor (Langfuse/Phoenix) + mirror; start direct, leave vendor optional.
    - Triage policy: when do lessons become backlog candidates (immediate/applied/pending); pilot a lightweight triage.
    - Privacy/PII masking: middleware redaction scope; adopt conservative masks for keys/tokens/headers.

  - Refined plan of action (consensus)
    - Use an OpenAI‑compatible proxy (FastAPI) in front of local models to log full JSON (masked).
    - Require structured scratchpad for local models via `.cursor/rules` (hypotheses/plan/risks/next_action).
    - Persist runs/steps/artifacts; add minimal `lessons` and `decisions` tables with link edges to PRDs/backlog.
    - Auto‑suggest backlog candidates from lessons; tag as `lesson‑derived` for review.
    - Keep acceptance tied to B‑1025 harness; do not change retrieval latency budgets.

  - Feature flags
    - FEATURE_PROXY_LOGS (default: off)
    - FEATURE_SCRATCHPAD (default: off; local models only)
    - FEATURE_LESSONS (default: off)

  - Phases
    - Phase 0: Flags & Contracts
      - Add env flags above; document JSON contract for proxy logging; add secret masking list.
    - Phase 1: Proxy & Logging
      - FastAPI middleware: forward to local model; log `{run_id, step_idx, role, messages, tool_calls, timings, scratchpad}` with masks.
      - Point Cursor "Custom API" to proxy (ngrok if needed) for local sessions only.
    - Phase 2: Minimal Schema
      - Tables: `runs`, `steps`, `artifacts` (light), `lessons(id, source_type, source_id, title, body, impact_weight, status, linked_prd, linked_run, linked_module, created_at)`, `decisions(id, context, options, decision, rationale, supersedes_id, created_at)`.
      - Optional telemetry: `tool_call_telemetry(id, run_id, tool_name, args_hash, success, elapsed_ms, created_at)` to evaluate tool effectiveness.
      - Citations: store with lessons (e.g., `lessons_citations(lesson_id, source_url, title, org)`), minimal join table.
      - Link edges: `lesson→backlog_item`, `lesson→decision`, `lesson→module_change`.
    - Phase 3: Cursor Rules & Emission
      - Add `.cursor/rules` requiring `<scratchpad>` for local agents; structured fields persisted to `steps.thought` and redacted summary.
      - Researcher: allow @Web usage for vetted retrieval; log sources into lesson citations.
      - Keywords/Brainstorming: maintain a small lexicon to tag runs with `brainstorming=true` when triggers appear; include tags in steps.
    - Phase 4: Backlog Integration
      - Seeds importer: ingest YouTube transcripts and external notes into lessons/seeds, linking back to PRDs and storing citations.
      - Triage pipeline: immediate/applied/pending; auto‑suggest backlog candidates tagged `lesson‑derived` or `seed`.
      - Views/queries: list decisions/lessons per PRD; show supporting lessons for a backlog item.
    - Phase 5: Evaluation & Acceptance
      - Verify capture coverage, linkage integrity, zero regression on B‑1025 latency; demo end‑to‑end flow from PRD → run → lesson → backlog.

  - Acceptance tests (machine‑verifiable where possible)
    - Coverage: proxy logs ≥95% local requests; scratchpad present on ≥80%.
    - Knowledge: ≥20 lessons, ≥10 decisions captured with valid foreign keys; ≥5 backlog candidates suggested.
    - Latency: when FEATURE_PROXY_LOGS=off, no measurable change vs B‑1025; when on, overhead ≤+50ms p50 for local runs.
    - Queries: given PRD X, returns ≥3 linked lessons; given backlog item Y, returns supporting lessons set.

  - Risks & Mitigations
    - Data bloat: add daily rotation and size caps; summarize long scratchpads.
    - PII leakage: strict masking policy and tests; opt‑out flag.
    - Scope creep: keep schema minimal; vendor observability optional; defer analytics to a later item.

  - Rollback
    - Flip FEATURE_* flags off to disable capture and emissions; tables remain inert; retrieval pipeline (B‑1025) unaffected.

    - Phase 4: Enhanced Multi‑Agent Integration (1.5h)
      - Hybrid moderator routes @addressed agents or selects top‑N by relevance
      - Collects ≤2 responses within 2.2s
      - Speaker‑aware agent selection based on voice characteristics
      - Noise‑suppressed roundtable for better multi‑agent communication

      - Document Mode A (VM‑only) defaults; Mode B (host mirror) optional; Mode C (guarded host control) documented with HITL approvals

  - Performance targets
    - STT endpoint→text: ≤ 800ms p50, ≤ 1500ms p90 (with noise suppression)
    - TTS 200–400 chars: ≤ 500ms p50, ≤ 900ms p90 (Piper/VibeVoice/Coqui)
    - Noise Suppression: < 100ms real‑time processing latency
    - Speaker Adaptation: < 200ms identification + adaptation
    - VibeVoice TTS: ≤ 600ms for 200‑400 chars (alternative option)
    - Moderator collect: ≤ 2200ms deadline; ≤ 2 speakers returned; cancel stragglers
    - CPU/memory steady within local M‑series budget; no GPU hard requiremen

  - Security & privacy
    - Default VM‑only; host actions disabled
    - Redact secrets from spoken text before logging (basic mask list shared with B‑1026)
    - Opt‑out flag to disable recording; rotation + size caps

    - Cross‑links: reference B‑1024 (Dual‑Mode Troubleshooting) for View‑Only vs VM Privileged modes; reference B‑1025 (context accuracy) and B‑1026 (closed‑loop capture)

  - Rollback
    - Flip FEATURE_STT/FEATURE_TTS/FEATURE_VOICE_ROLES/FEATURE_VOICE_ROUNDTABLE/FEATURE_NOISE_SUPPRESSION/FEATURE_SPEAKER_ADAPTATION/FEATURE_VIBEVOICE_TTS off; voice code inert; text workflows unchanged

  - Risks & mitigations
    - False wake‑word triggers → increase threshold, require double‑hit, prefer PTT mode by default
    - Latency spikes → use smaller STT models (base.en/small.en), int8 compute; pre‑render short TTS
    - Audio device issues → document macOS permissions and VM audio routing
    - Noise suppression quality → fallback to traditional filtering, configurable sensitivity, real‑time monitoring
    - Speaker adaptation accuracy → fallback to default profiles, learning rate adjustment, minimum sample requirements
    - VibeVoice performance → fallback to Piper, performance monitoring, alternative TTS options

   class LearningLoop(user_id: str)
   - propose(user_text: str, context: dict) -> {answer, assumptions, confidences, evidence, questions, policy_id}
   - calibrate(corrections: dict) -> {distances, reward, next_policy_id}

PHASE 2 — Storage & Schemas (0.5h)
4) Persist state using existing dirs:
   - 100_memory/user_profiles/{user_id}.json  (knobs: verbosity, clarify_first; lexicon: term→embedding_id; bandit_state)
   - artifacts/session_memory/turns.jsonl     (one row/turn: prompt, assumptions, corrections, distances, reward, policy, evidence, ts)
PHASE 3 — Assumptions & Feedback (1.0h)
5) Assumptions extractor: emit JSON with slots: intent, constraints, priorities, glossary, uncertainties + confidences; evidence as file paths/IDs.
6) Feedback: accept corrections JSON {confirm, correct, missing, priority_order}; compute distances:
   - semantic: cosine between intent_texts; slot deltas (Jaccard); calibration (Brier/ECE if confidence provided).
   - reward = 1 − normalized_distance.

PHASE 4 — Policy Selector (0.5h)
7) Epsilon‑greedy bandit over 3‑5 prompting micro‑policies (e.g., clarify_first, structured_summary, examples_minimal). Context features: last distances, uncertainty count.

PHASE 5 — Profile Update (0.5h)
8) Update knobs (raise/lower clarify_first), update lexicon centroid embeddings, update bandit stats. Write JSONL turn log.

PHASE 6 — Integration & UI Hooks (1.0h)
9) Wire into reply path: load profile → select policy → draft answer → emit assumptions + 1‑2 targeted questions (lowest confidence). After user correction, call calibrate(), update profile, choose next policy.
10) Add collapsible "Assumptions Summary" block and a compact correction form schema.

PHASE 7 — Tests & Metrics (1.0h)
11) Add tests: profile load/save, distance math, bandit update/selection, facade end‑to‑end dry‑run.
12) Metrics: track moving average distance, win‑rate per policy, time‑to‑clarity; ensure zero regression when FEATURE_PREFERENCE_LOOP=off.

ROLLBACK
13) Flip FEATURE_PREFERENCE_LOOP=off → loop inert; normal behavior restored; logs/profile untouched.

3. VALIDATION HOOKS (scripts/backlog_validator.py):
   - Pre-commit hook for JSON schema validation with MoSCoW rules
   - Runtime validation preventing invalid data with clear error messages
   - Performance optimization: <1 second for 100 items validation
   - Bypass options for emergency situations with audit logging
   - Integration with existing doc_coherence_validator.py patterns
   - Validation error logging for debugging and improvement

4. MARKDOWN GENERATION (scripts/backlog_markdown_generator.py):
   - Generate 000_backlog.md from backlog.json with MoSCoW indicators
   - Preserve all existing metadata and HTML comment patterns
   - Auto-generated banner with clear indicators and last update timestamp
   - Performance: <1 second generation for 100 items
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing workflow tools
   - Support for custom templates and formatting options

5. SCRIBE PACK SYSTEM (scripts/scribe_backlog_packs.py):

   - Integration tests: end-to-end workflow from JSON to markdown
   - Performance tests: validation speed, generation time, UI responsiveness
   - User acceptance tests: solo developer workflow validation
   - Regression tests: existing workflow compatibility
   - Coverage target: 90% for new components, 100% for critical paths

9. DOCUMENTATION UPDATE (400_guides/ and 000_core/):
   - Update all workflow documentation to reflect new template file names
   - Update 400_guides/400_development-workflow.md with new 001-003 template references

   - Validate all documentation links and references work correctly

10. COMMIT AND BRANCH POLICY:
   - Branch naming: feature/B-<id>-<slug> (e.g., feature/B-1025-lean-hybrid-memory)
   - Commit message (conventional): type(scope): short summary B-<id>
   - Example: feat(backlog): add HybridRetriever + reranker scaffolding B-1025
   - Grouping rule: one logical change per commit mapped to a single backlog ID; do not mix IDs in the same commi
   - PR title: B-<id>: concise title; PR body links to backlog item and PRD path; include acceptance gates and flags touched
   - Traceability: maintain links both ways (backlog ↔ PR ↔ PRD); record final acceptance in backlog implementation_notes
   - Rollback: each PR must specify flags toggled and a one-line revert plan
   - Enforcement: CI check that commit subject ends with "B-<id>" and PR body includes backlog/PRD links
   - Document header: new/updated .md artifacts must include an HTML comment under the H1 with parent backlog, e.g., <!-- parent_backlog: B-1025 -->
   - PR template: include fields for Backlog ID (B-####) and Artifacts added/updated (paths)

TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Zero breaking changes to existing workflow (001-003 chain)
- Maintain backward compatibility with current markdown forma
- Use existing infrastructure: NiceGUI, Scribe, LTST memory
- Local-first approach with no external dependencies
- Governance-friendly: version-controlled JSON, human-readable markdown
- Performance targets: <2s CLI operations, <1s validation, <500ms UI updates

PERFORMANCE TARGETS:
- JSON schema validation: <100ms per item
- CLI operations: <2 seconds response time
- Markdown generation: <1 second for 100 items
- UI dashboard updates: <500ms response time
- Migration process: <30 seconds for full backlog
- Scribe pack generation: <5 seconds per pack

QUALITY GATES:
- All JSON data must pass schema validation with MoSCoW rules
- Generated markdown must display MoSCoW priorities clearly
- CLI must handle all operations without errors
- Dashboard must update in real-time without performance issues
- Migration must preserve 100% of existing metadata
- Scribe packs must capture comprehensive knowledge from completed work

## Backlog Working Agreements

- WIP limit: at most 2 items may be marked in‑progress at any time.

- Status normalization: use only `todo`, `in‑progress`, `blocked`, `done`.

- Next actionable: every `todo` should include a one‑line `do_next` metadata to enable immediate start.

- Blockers: note `blocked_by` when external dependencies (credentials, infra, decisions) apply.

- Acceptance criteria: add an `acceptance` note or PRD link to enable quick verification.

- Estimated hours: include `est_hours` (2–4h granularity) to improve planning.

- Grooming cadence: add `review_on` dates and sweep monthly to reduce drift.

- Ordering: keep this table ordered by score, then dependencies; append new items at the end.

- Tooling flags: use booleans like `needs_strict_anchors` or `needs_precommit_gate` for rollout items.

Metadata fields (HTML comments under each item):

- `<!-- do_next: ... -->`, `<!-- blocked_by: ... -->`, `<!-- acceptance: ... -->`, `<!-- est_hours: N -->`, `<!--
review_on: YYYY-MM-DD -->`

## Current Priority Items

### B-1024: Implement 5-Layer Memory System with Hybrid Rankers and Pruner
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Status:** Ready for Implementation
**Estimated Effort:** 18 days
**Dependencies:** None

**Context:**
Based on ChatGPT consultation and local DSPy model validation, we need to implement a sophisticated 5-layer memory system to enhance our AI development ecosystem. This builds upon our existing LTST (Long-Term Short-Term) memory system with advanced ranking, pruning, and entity management capabilities.

**Current System Analysis:**
- **LTST Memory System**: Currently uses `priority_score = (relevance_score * 0.7) + (recency_score * 0.3)`
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector for embeddings
- **Existing Tables**: `conversation_memory`, `context_chunks`, `entity_facts`
- **Current Ranking**: Simple relevance + recency weighting

**Proposed 5-Layer Architecture:**
1. **Turn Buffer** (FIFO) - Short-term memory
2. **Rolling Summary** - Compact, continually updated conversation summary
3. **Entity/Fact Store** - Structured key-value records for authoritative facts
4. **Episodic Memory** - Sparse log of important events
5. **Semantic Index** - Chunks with embeddings for long-term recall

**New Components to Implement:**
- **Hybrid Rankers**: Combine cosine similarity, BM25 (lexical search), and recency weighting
- **Pruner**: Intelligent eviction with audit logs and usage tracking
- **UPSERT Helpers**: Entity facts with versioning and contradiction handling
- **build_context()**: Orchestrate fetching from 5 layers with diversity and token caps

**Implementation Plan:**

#### Phase 1: Database Schema Implementation (2 days)
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `conv_chunks` table with HNSW index and tsvector for BM25
- [ ] Create `rolling_summaries` table for session-level summaries
- [ ] Create `entity_facts` table with versioning and status tracking
- [ ] Create `episodes` table for episodic memory
- [ ] Add indexes for performance optimization
- [ ] Create `conv_prune_log` table for audit trails
