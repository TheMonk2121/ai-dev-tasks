### **📝 Adding New Test Results**

#### **When You Complete an Experiment:**
1. **Find the relevant testing log** (retrieval, memory, or integration)
2. **Locate the experiment section** for your specific tes
3. **Fill in the results** using the structured template:
   - Date and test environmen
   - Results and metrics
   - What worked and what didn'
   - Lessons learned

#### **Example Update:**
```markdown
#### **Experiment 1: Initial Weight Optimization**
- **Date**: 2025-01-15
- **Test Environment**: macOS 14.0, Python 3.12, 16GB RAM
- **Results**:
  - Best Configuration: α=0.7, β=0.5, γ=0.3, δ=0.9, λ=0.1
  - Performance Improvement: 15% increase in top-5 hit rate
  - Top-5 Hit Rate: 0.85 (up from 0.74)
- **What Worked**: Higher cosine weight (α=0.7) improved semantic relevance
- **What Didn't**: Very high recency weight (γ>0.7) caused overfitting
- **Lessons Learned**: Balance between semantic and temporal relevance is crucial
