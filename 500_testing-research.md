## Key Findings
- AI-oriented testing must blend deterministic tests (parsers/validators) with model-evaluation checks (answer faithfulness and citation presence) to handle nondeterminism.
- Metamorphic testing (invariants under paraphrase/format changes) is effective for prompts and retrieval pipelines.
- Property-based tests reveal edge cases in chunking, retrieval, sanitization where fixed cases miss defects.
- CI should gate on RAG metrics (e.g., retrieval recall@k, citation faithfulness) and on basic security tests (prompt-injection refusal, PII redaction).
- Flake management: constrained reruns (1â€“2) and tolerance bands reduce false negatives while still catching drift.
 - Align test oracles with span-grounded citations: sentence-level faithfulness against retrieved chunks improves precision of failures (400_documentation-retrieval-guide.md).

## Actionable Patterns
- Metamorphic tests: define invariants (e.g., answers must still cite sources after benign question paraphrase) and assert they hold.
- Property-based generators: fuzz chunk sizes/overlaps; validate retrieval coverage and citation offsets remain consistent.
- RAG evaluation in CI: maintain a seed QA set; assert recall@5 and faithfulness meet thresholds; fail on regression.
- Security checks: adversarial prompts must be refused; outputs must not contain PII/secrets (regex screens) before passing.
- Flake policy: allow up to 2 reruns only for model-eval tests; record variance and alert on significant drift.
 - Deterministic harnesses for non-LLM code (indexers, sanitizers) ensure reproducible failures separate from model noise (400_testing-strategy-guide.md).
