## 1. Problem Statement

### What's Broken?
The current LTST Memory System lacks industry-standard MCP (Model Context Protocol) file processing capabilities for drag-and-drop JSON/code files. Users cannot seamlessly analyze documents, extract context, or process files within the AI development ecosystem, limiting the system's ability to handle real-world development scenarios.

### Why Does It Matter?
- **Context Loss**: Important file content and insights are not captured in conversation memory
- **Manual Overhead**: Users must manually copy/paste file contents instead of drag-and-drop
- **Limited Integration**: No seamless connection between file analysis and LTST memory system
- **Reduced Productivity**: Development workflow is fragmented without file processing capabilities

### What's the Opportunity?
By integrating industry-standard MCP tools (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen) with the LTST Memory System, we can create a seamless drag-and-drop file processing experience that automatically extracts context, analyzes code, and stores insights in conversation memory, significantly enhancing the AI development ecosystem's capabilities.

## 2. Solution Overview

### What Are We Building?
A comprehensive MCP file processing integration system that enables drag-and-drop handling of JSON, Python, Markdown, and other code files with intelligent context extraction and LTST memory integration.

### How Does It Work?
1. **File Drop Interface**: Users drag files into the system interface
2. **MCP Processing Pipeline**: Industry-standard MCP tools (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen) process files
3. **Context Extraction**: Intelligent analysis extracts relevant context and metadata
4. **LTST Integration**: Extracted context is stored in conversation memory
5. **AI Enhancement**: Context is available for future AI interactions

### What Are the Key Features?
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Seamless file upload and processing
- **Multi-Format Support**: JSON, Python, Markdown, YAML, and other code files
- **Intelligent Context Extraction**: AST analysis, schema validation, and metadata extraction
- **LTST Memory Integration**: Automatic storage in conversation history
- **Real-time Processing**: Immediate feedback and context availability
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of malformed or unsupported files

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

### How Do We Know It's Done?
- [ ] Users can drag and drop JSON files and see processed content in LTST memory
- [ ] Users can drag and drop Python files with AST analysis and context extraction
- [ ] System integrates with existing LTST Memory System without breaking changes
- [ ] File processing completes within 5 seconds for files up to 1MB
- [ ] Context extraction accuracy exceeds 90% for supported file types
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages unsupported or malformed files

### What Does Success Look Like?
- **Seamless Integration**: File processing feels native to the LTST Memory System
- **Intelligent Analysis**: Extracted context is relevant and useful for AI interactions
- **Performance**: File processing doesn't impact system responsiveness
- **Reliability**: System handles edge cases and errors gracefully
