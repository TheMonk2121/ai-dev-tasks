<!-- CONTEXT_REFERENCE: 400_context-priority-guide.md -->

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Maintain a set of critical rules that are always provided to the AI
- Include in system prompt or appended to every user message
- Act as an ever-present safety net
- Keep concise to avoid attention decay

### **Pattern 6: Cross-Reference and Dependency Mapping**
**Effectiveness**: Medium. This pattern ensures availability of context.
**Recommendation**: Continue to enrich cross-references in our docs.

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Strengthen documentation by mapping out dependencies
- Use that map to inform context provision
- Maintain an index or matrix of references
- Create automated tools to show "if you're looking at X, also check Y"

## üìã Research Context

### **Current Documentation Architecture**
Our project uses a sophisticated cognitive scaffolding system designed to maintain state across Cursor AI sessions and ensure coherent documentation updates. The system is built around a hierarchical file structure with specific naming conventions and cross-reference patterns.

### **Key Research Questions**
1. **How does our current file hierarchy impact AI analysis?**
2. **What is the cognitive scaffolding system and how does it work?**
3. **How do we ensure coherence when documents are updated?**
4. **What are the relationships between files and how are they maintained?**
5. **How does the system rehydrate Cursor AI with crucial information?**

## üèóÔ∏è Current System Analysis

### **File Hierarchy & Naming Conventions**

#### **Priority-Based File Organization**
Our system uses a three-digit prefix naming convention to establish hierarchy:

**HIGH Priority (Read First):**
- `100_cursor-memory-context.md` - Memory scaffold and current state
- `400_system-overview_advanced_features.md` - Technical architecture  
- `000_backlog.md` - Current priorities and roadmap
- `400_project-overview.md` - Project overview and workflow

**MEDIUM Priority (Read as Needed):**
- `001_create-prd.md` - PRD creation workflow
- `002_generate-tasks.md` - Task generation workflow
- `003_process-task-list.md` - AI execution workflow
- `104_dspy-development-context.md` - Deep technical context

**LOW Priority (Read for Specific Tasks):**
- `103_yi-coder-integration.md` - Integration details
- `201_model-configuration.md` - Model setup
- `100_backlog-guide.md` - Backlog management

#### **Cross-Reference System**
Files use structured comment patterns to establish relationships:

```markdown
<!-- ESSENTIAL_FILES: 400_project-overview.md, 400_system-overview_advanced_features.md, 000_backlog.md -->
<!-- IMPLEMENTATION_FILES: 104_dspy-development-context.md, 202_setup-requirements.md -->
<!-- DOMAIN_FILES: 100_backlog-guide.md, 103_yi-coder-integration.md -->
```
