# LM Studio Setup Verification

## Current Status
✅ LM Studio is installed and running  
❌ LM Studio server is not started  
❌ Yi-Coder model is not loaded  

## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### 1. Start LM Studio Server

1. **Open LM Studio application**
2. **Go to the "Local Server" tab** (usually in the top navigation)
3. **Click "Start Server" button**
4. **Verify server status** - you should see a green indicator showing the server is running
5. **Note the server URL** - it should be `http://localhost:1234`

### 2. Load Yi-Coder Model

1. **Go to "My Models" tab**
2. **If Yi-Coder-9B-Chat-Q6_K is not listed:**
   - Go to "Search" tab
   - Search for "Yi-Coder-9B-Chat-Q6_K"
   - Download the model (may take 10-30 minutes)
3. **If model is available:**
   - Click "Load" button next to Yi-Coder-9B-Chat-Q6_K
   - Wait for model to load into memory

### 3. Verify Setup

After completing steps 1 and 2, run this verification command:

```bash
node test_lm_studio_integration.js
```

You should see:
- ✅ LM Studio server is running
- ✅ Yi-Coder model found
- ✅ Code generation successful
- ✅ Response time under 2 seconds

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
- Check if port 1234 is available
- Restart LM Studio
- Check firewall settings
- Try a different port if needed

### Model Won't Load
- Verify you have at least 8GB RAM available
- Check disk space (need ~6GB for model)
- Try loading with lower context length
- Restart LM Studio

### Slow Performance
- Close other applications
- Reduce context length in LM Studio settings
- Use GPU acceleration if available
- Lower temperature setting

## Expected Test Results

When everything is working correctly, you should see:

```

## Next Steps

Once the tests pass:

1. **Test the extension** with Cursor IDE
2. **Configure extension settings** in Cursor
3. **Test real-world scenarios** with actual code generation
4. **Optimize performance** if needed

## Support

If you continue to have issues:

1. **Check LM Studio documentation**
2. **Verify system requirements** (8GB+ RAM, 6GB+ disk space)
3. **Try with a simpler model first** to test basic functionality
4. **Check LM Studio logs** for error messages
