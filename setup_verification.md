<!-- CONTEXT_REFERENCE: 400_context-priority-guide.md -->

### Model Won't Load
- Verify you have at least 8GB RAM available
- Check disk space (need ~6GB for model)
- Try loading with lower context length
- Restart LM Studio

### Slow Performance
- Close other applications
- Reduce context length in LM Studio settings
- Use GPU acceleration if available
- Lower temperature setting

## Expected Test Results

When everything is working correctly, you should see:

```

```

## Next Steps

Once the tests pass:

1. **Test the extension** with Cursor IDE
2. **Configure extension settings** in Cursor
3. **Test real-world scenarios** with actual code generation
4. **Optimize performance** if needed

## Support

If you continue to have issues:

1. **Check LM Studio documentation**
2. **Verify system requirements** (8GB+ RAM, 6GB+ disk space)
3. **Try with a simpler model first** to test basic functionality
4. **Check LM Studio logs** for error messages
