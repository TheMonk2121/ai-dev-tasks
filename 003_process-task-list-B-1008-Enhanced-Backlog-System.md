# Process Task List: B-1008 Enhanced Backlog System (Industry-Standard + Solo-Optimized)

**Project**: B-1008 Enhanced Backlog System
**Status**: todo
**Priority**: 🔥 High (MoSCoW: Must)
**Dependencies**: B-1006-A (completed), B-1007 (next priority)
**Estimated Hours**: 16
**Score**: 6.5
**Solo Optimization**: 🚀 One-command workflows, visual interface, auto-advance

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

Implement an enhanced backlog system that combines industry best practices (MoSCoW prioritization, visual Kanban, dynamic reprioritization) with solo developer optimizations (one-command workflows, context preservation, auto-advance). The system includes structured JSON data, visual NiceGUI dashboard, AI-driven prioritization, and comprehensive knowledge mining.

## 🚀 **Solo Developer Quick Start**

### One Command Workflow
```bash
# Start everything (backlog intake → PRD → tasks → execution)
python3 scripts/solo_workflow.py start "Enhanced backlog system with industry standards"

# Continue where you left off
python3 scripts/solo_workflow.py continue

# Ship when done
python3 scripts/solo_workflow.py ship
```

### Context Preservation
- **LTST Memory**: Maintains context across sessions
- **Auto-Advance**: Tasks auto-advance unless you pause
- **Smart Pausing**: Pause only for critical decisions or external dependencies
