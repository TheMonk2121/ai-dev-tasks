## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
./install_dependencies.sh

# Run governance check
python3 scripts/doc_coherence_validator.py --ci --json

# Run tests
python3 -m pytest tests/ -m "tier_1 and unit"

# Generate status badge
python3 scripts/generate_status_badge.py
```

## Project Structure

- **`000_core/`** - Core workflows and backlog management
- **`100_memory/`** - Memory context and development state
- **`200_setup/`** - Environment setup and configuration
- **`400_guides/`** - Development guides and runbooks
- **`500_research/`** - Research and reference materials
- **`dspy-rag-system/`** - DSPy RAG system implementation
- **`scripts/`** - Automation and utility scripts
- **`tests/`** - Test suite and validation

## Governance System

This project uses a comprehensive governance system with:

- **Validator**: Checks for violations across all categories
- **Ratchet**: Prevents regression in readme/multirep violations
- **Flip Automation**: Automatically flips categories to FAIL mode when clean
- **Rollback Protection**: Automatic rollback for >5% false positives
- **Schema Guard**: Prevents unauthorized schema changes
- **Owner Accountability**: Suggested owners for violations

### SLOs (Service Level Objectives)
- **PR path time**: â‰¤5 min p95
- **Nightly duration**: â‰¤15 min p95
- **False positives**: <1% per week
- **Time-to-flip**: â‰¤48h after clean window completion

## Development Workflow

1. **Backlog Management**: Use `000_core/000_backlog.md` for prioritization
2. **PR Creation**: Follow templates in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
3. **Governance Check**: All PRs must pass governance CI
4. **Testing**: Run comprehensive test suite before merging
5. **Documentation**: Update relevant guides and runbooks

## Key Commands

```bash
# Governance
make gov/validate          # Run validator
make gov/status           # Show current status
