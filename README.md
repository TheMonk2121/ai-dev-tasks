**The Problem**: Every development team starts with good intentions but abandons them under pressure. Structured data becomes unstructured markdown. Prioritization methods get replaced with "whatever's urgent." Knowledge mining stops happening. Workflow steps get bypassed. Quality gates become optional.

**Our Solution**: An AI development ecosystem that makes dropping good practices impossible through intelligent memory systems, automated governance, and context-aware workflows.

## üéØ Why This Exists

### **The Memory Problem in AI Development**

Traditional AI development suffers from **context amnesia**:
- **ChatGPT**: Loses context after 8K tokens, no persistent memory
- **Claude**: Better context but still resets between sessions
- **GitHub Copilot**: No understanding of your project's history or decisions
- **Cursor**: Great for coding but doesn't remember why you made certain choices

**Result**: Developers constantly re-explain context, repeat decisions, and lose valuable insights.

### **Our Memory System: LTST (Long-Term Short-Term)**

Unlike off-the-shelf solutions, our memory system provides:

- **Persistent Context**: Remembers decisions, patterns, and reasoning across months
- **Intelligent Retrieval**: Finds relevant context when you need it, not just when you ask
- **Decision Tracking**: Captures the "why" behind technical choices, not just the "what"
- **Cross-Session Continuity**: Picks up exactly where you left off, even weeks later

**Real Impact**: Instead of spending 30 minutes re-explaining your architecture to an AI, it already knows your patterns and can build on them.

### **The Backlog Problem in Development**

Most teams struggle with:
- **Priority Drift**: Important tasks get buried under urgent ones
- **Context Loss**: Why was this task important? What was the original goal?
- **Decision Amnesia**: We solved this before, but can't remember how
- **Scope Creep**: Tasks grow without clear boundaries or success criteria

### **Our Backlog System: Intelligent Prioritization**

Our system provides:
- **MoSCoW Prioritization**: Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have
- **Context Preservation**: Every task remembers its original purpose and constraints
- **Decision History**: Track how and why priorities changed over time
- **Success Metrics**: Clear criteria for when a task is "done"

**Real Impact**: Instead of endless priority debates, you have data-driven decisions with full context.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/TheMonk2121/ai-dev-tasks.git
cd ai-dev-tasks
poetry install
poetry run pre-commit install

# Run quality gates
poetry run pytest
poetry run black .
poetry run ruff check .
```

## üîß Core Workflows

- **Add backlog item**: `python3 scripts/backlog_intake.py`
- **Generate PRD**: `python3 scripts/prd_generator.py`
- **Execute tasks**: `python3 scripts/single_doorway.py`
- **Update memory**: `python3 scripts/update_cursor_memory.py`

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

### **Multi-Agent AI System**
Instead of a single AI that tries to do everything, we use specialized agents:
- **Planner**: Strategic thinking and backlog management
- **Implementer**: Code architecture and system design
- **Researcher**: Analysis and knowledge synthesis
- **Coder**: Development tooling and quality assurance

**Why This Matters**: Each agent has deep expertise in their domain, leading to better decisions and faster execution.

### **Memory Rehydration**
Before any AI interaction, our system automatically loads relevant context:

```bash
export POSTGRES_DSN="mock://test" && python3 scripts/unified_memory_orchestrator.py --systems ltst cursor go_cli prime --role planner "current project status and core documentation"
```

**What This Does**:
- Loads your project's decision history
- Retrieves relevant patterns and solutions
- Provides context-aware recommendations
- Ensures continuity across sessions

### **Quality Gates**
Automated validation that prevents common development mistakes:
- **Schema Validation**: Ensures data models stay consistent
- **Performance Checks**: Catches performance regressions early
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Documentation Validation**: Ensures docs stay current

**Real Impact**: Instead of discovering problems in production, you catch them during development.
