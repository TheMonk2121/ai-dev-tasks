# 🚀 AI Development Tasks – A Local-First AI Dev Ecosystem

Build faster, with memory and structure.
An end-to-end framework that turns messy AI workflows into clear, repeatable development pipelines.

## 🎯 Why This Exists

Building AI features today is chaotic:

- **Context gets lost** between sessions
- **Agents behave inconsistently** across tools
- **Workflows sprawl** across half a dozen tools
- **Quality and testing** lag behind speed
- **Decisions and patterns** are forgotten over time

This repo is my answer: a production-ready, local-first AI development ecosystem that brings order to AI-powered development.

## 🧩 What It Gives You

🤖 **Multi-Agent Roles** – Planner, Implementer, Researcher, and Coder that collaborate with shared memory

🧠 **LTST Memory System** – Persistent context that remembers decisions, patterns, and reasoning across months

🔍 **Advanced RAG** – PostgreSQL + PGVector for semantic context retrieval and instant rehydration

⚡ **DSPy 3.0** – Structured pipelines, enhanced assertions, and production-ready orchestration

🔄 **Single Doorway Workflow** – From backlog → PRD → tasks → execution → archive, all automated

📊 **Quality Gates** – Automated validation that prevents common development mistakes

## 🏗️ How It's Built

## 🚀 Quick Demo

```bash
# 1. Clone & setup
git clone https://github.com/TheMonk2121/ai-dev-tasks.git
cd ai-dev-tasks
poetry install
poetry run pre-commit install

# 2. Load project context (memory rehydration)
export POSTGRES_DSN="mock://test" && python3 scripts/unified_memory_orchestrator.py --systems ltst cursor go_cli prime --role planner "current project status and core documentation"

# 3. Generate your first feature
python3 scripts/single_doorway.py generate "Add user authentication system"

# 4. Watch it work
# ✅ Creates a PRD with requirements
# ✅ Breaks into tasks
# ✅ Executes with AI + quality gates
# ✅ Tracks progress on the dashboard
# ✅ Archives with context + lessons learned
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics

| Problem | Before | After | Impact |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Context Loss** | 30 min re-explaining | Instant context loading | **95% time saved** |
| **Priority Drift** | Endless debates | Data-driven decisions | **Clear direction** |
| **Decision Amnesia** | Repeat mistakes | Pattern recognition | **Learning acceleration** |
| **Quality Issues** | Production bugs | Early detection | **Reliability improvement** |
| **Documentation** | Outdated docs | Auto-validation | **Always current** |

## 🔒 Production-Ready

- **Input validation** + prompt sanitization
- **Health checks** + performance benchmarks
- **Automated HotFix generation** + recovery
- **Local-first design** with PostgreSQL + PGVector

- **Pre-commit hooks** with 100% compliance

## 🤝 Who This Is For

- **Solo Developers**: Who want professional-grade tooling without the overhead
- **Small Teams**: Who need to scale their development practices
- **Technical Leads**: Who want to enforce standards without being the bottleneck
- **Product Managers**: Who need visibility into technical decisions and progress
- **Stakeholders**: Who want to understand the "why" behind technical choices
