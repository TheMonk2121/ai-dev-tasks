# 🚀 AI Development Tasks – A Local-First AI Dev Ecosystem

Build faster, with memory and structure.
An end-to-end framework that turns messy AI workflows into clear, repeatable development pipelines.

## 🎯 Why This Exists

Building AI features today is chaotic:

- **Context gets lost** between sessions
- **Agents behave inconsistently** across tools
- **Workflows sprawl** across half a dozen tools
- **Quality and testing** lag behind speed
- **Decisions and patterns** are forgotten over time

This repo is my answer: a production-ready, local-first AI development ecosystem that brings order to AI-powered development.

## 🧭 Start Here (Agents)

- Zero‑context onboarding: `START_HERE_FOR_AGENTS.md`
- Run the evals (SOP): `000_core/000_evaluation-system-entry-point.md`
- Evaluations entry point: `000_core/000_evaluation-system-entry-point.md`
- Memory quick start: `400_guides/400_01_memory-system-architecture.md`

## 🧩 What It Gives You

🤖 **Multi-Agent Roles** – Planner, Implementer, Researcher, and Coder that collaborate with shared memory

🧠 **LTST Memory System** – Persistent context that remembers decisions, patterns, and reasoning across months

🔍 **Advanced RAG** – PostgreSQL + PGVector for semantic context retrieval and instant rehydration

⚡ **DSPy 3.0** – Structured pipelines, enhanced assertions, and production-ready orchestration

🔄 **Single Doorway Workflow** – From backlog → PRD → tasks → execution → archive, all automated

📊 **Quality Gates** – Automated validation that prevents common development mistakes

## ⚡ UV Package Management

This project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast, reliable dependency management. UV is a Rust-based Python package manager that's significantly faster than pip.

### Key UV Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies from pyproject.toml
uv sync

# Install with development dependencies
uv sync --extra dev

# Run commands in the environment (no activation needed)
uv run python scripts/system_health_check.py
uv run pytest
uv run pre-commit run --all-files

# Update lock file
uv lock

# Add new dependencies
uv add package-name
uv add --dev package-name  # Development dependency
```

### Migration Benefits

- **Speed**: 10-100x faster dependency resolution and installation
- **Reliability**: Deterministic builds with `uv.lock`
- **Simplicity**: One tool replaces pip + virtualenv + pip-tools
- **Compatibility**: Works with existing `requirements.txt` files

### Legacy Support

The project maintains backward compatibility with `requirements.txt` files in subdirectories while using `pyproject.toml` as the primary dependency source.

### CI/CD Integration

All GitHub Actions workflows have been updated to use UV for faster, more reliable builds:

- **Quick Check**: Uses UV for dependency installation
- **Deep Audit**: UV-powered conflict detection
- **Evaluation Pipeline**: UV for ML dependencies (DSPy, PyTorch, etc.)
- **RAGChecker**: UV for evaluation tools
- **Maintenance Validation**: UV for maintenance scripts
