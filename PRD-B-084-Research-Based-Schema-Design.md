## 1. Executive Summary

**Project**: Research-Based Schema Design for Extraction
**Backlog ID**: B-084
**Priority**: 6.0 points (High)
**Estimated Effort**: 8 hours
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Stakeholders**: AI Development Team, Research Team

**Success Metrics**:
- Schema validation accuracy ≥ 95%
- Extraction quality improvement ≥ 30%
- Research integration coverage ≥ 80%
- Schema reusability across 3+ extraction domains

## 2. Problem Statement

**Current State**: The current extraction system uses basic, hardcoded schemas that don't leverage research findings or adapt to different content types. This results in:
- Inconsistent extraction quality across different document types
- Manual schema updates required for new content formats
- Limited adaptability to research-based best practices
- Poor performance on complex, multi-format documents

**Pain Points**:
- Extraction accuracy varies significantly (40-70% depending on content type)
- Schemas are not research-backed or validated
- No systematic approach to schema evolution
- Limited integration with existing research findings

**Opportunity**: Design research-based extraction schemas that improve data quality, reduce manual intervention, and leverage existing research infrastructure.

**Impact**: Improved extraction quality will enhance the entire AI development ecosystem, from documentation processing to backlog management.
