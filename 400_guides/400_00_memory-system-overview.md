## üß† **Memory System Overview**

The memory system is the **foundation** of this AI development ecosystem. It provides:

### **Core Functions:**
1. **Context Rehydration** - Restore project state across sessions
2. **Knowledge Persistence** - Maintain project history and decisions
3. **Cross-Session Continuity** - Seamless workflow across development sessions
4. **Decision Intelligence** - Track and learn from past decisions

### **Key Components:**
- **LTST Memory System** - Long-term storage and retrieval
- **Cursor Memory Context** - IDE-specific context management
- **DSPy Role System** - AI agent role management
- **Backlog Integration** - Task and priority management

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

### **For New Users:**
1. **Read this file** (00) - Understand the memory system overview
2. **Read 01** - Learn about memory system architecture
3. **Read 02** - Understand memory rehydration and context management
4. **Use memory rehydration** - Run `scripts/memory_up.sh` to get current context

### **For Returning Users:**
1. **Rehydrate memory** - Run `scripts/memory_up.sh` to restore context
2. **Check current state** - Review `100_cursor-memory-context.md`
3. **Continue from where you left off** - Use the memory system to resume work

## üîß **Essential Commands**

```bash
# Memory rehydration (restore project context)
./scripts/memory_up.sh

# DSPy memory orchestrator (advanced context)
export POSTGRES_DSN="mock://test" && python3 scripts/unified_memory_orchestrator.py --systems cursor --role planner "current project status"

# Check memory system status
python3 scripts/memory_system_status.py
```
